# Adverse Information and Allegations Surrounding Spectranetics Corp.

**Spectranetics Corporation** – a Colorado Springs-based medical laser device manufacturer – has faced several significant legal and regulatory controversies. Below is a summary of key adverse information and allegations involving the company, including government investigations, executive legal issues, shareholder litigation, and product safety warnings.

## Federal Investigation and Settlement (2008–2009)

In September 2008, agents from the FDA and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) **raided Spectranetics’ offices** with a search warrant. The warrant sought documents related to the company’s sales and marketing practices, two post-market clinical studies (conducted 2002–2005), and **“payments made to medical personnel”** in connection with those studies. This raid signaled a federal investigation into Spectranetics’ business practices.

**Allegations:** The U.S. Department of Justice later outlined *multiple regulatory and legal violations* by Spectranetics. According to a December 2009 DOJ press release, the company had **illegally imported unapproved medical devices** and provided them to physicians for use in patients, conducted a clinical study in a manner that violated federal regulations, and **promoted certain products for medical procedures without FDA approval or clearance**. These actions allegedly occurred in the early-to-mid 2000s and even led to the submission of **false claims to Medicare** (for device procedures not approved by FDA) between 2003 and 2008. The products involved included Spectranetics’ own laser ablation systems and related catheters (such as the Turbo Elite and Turbo-Booster devices), as well as guidewires and balloon catheters sourced from third parties overseas,.

**Settlement:** In late 2009, Spectranetics reached a settlement with federal authorities. The company **agreed to pay $4.9 million in civil damages plus a $100,000 forfeiture** to resolve the DOJ’s fraud and FDA-related allegations. As part of the resolution, Spectranetics entered into a non-prosecution agreement – meaning it accepted responsibility and implemented remedial measures in exchange for avoiding criminal charges. The company also signed a **Corporate Integrity Agreement** with the Department of Health and Human Services’ Inspector General, mandating improved compliance and external monitoring of its clinical trials and regulatory reporting,. In sum, Spectranetics paid the penalties and agreed to strict oversight to settle the investigation, **without admitting formal wrongdoing in court** (the claims were resolved before any criminal trial).

## Criminal Charges Against Management (2010–2012)

The fallout from the federal probe led to individual accountability efforts. In August 2010, a federal grand jury **indicted three former Spectranetics executives** – including *ex-CEO John G. Schulte* – and a company consultant on an array of criminal charges. The 12-count indictment charged these individuals with **conspiracy, making false statements, importation violations, and introducing adulterated/misbranded medical devices into interstate commerce**, among other offenses. 

According to the indictment, between 2004 and 2008 the defendants conspired to **evade FDA regulation and U.S. Customs laws** in connection with Spectranetics’ products. For example, they allegedly **imported medical devices using false customs declarations** (misstating the devices’ description, value, or intended use) and then **distributed those unapproved devices for human use** in patients. The indictment further claimed the former executives **unlawfully promoted these devices for unapproved (off-label) uses** and deliberately **concealed their activities** from Spectranetics’ internal compliance officials as well as from FDA and Homeland Security investigators. (Notably, the DOJ press release announcing the charges pointed out that Spectranetics had *already paid $5 million to settle related civil/criminal matters* and was cooperating with the government at that time.)

**Outcomes:** The criminal cases against the former executives concluded in 2012. After a five-week trial in early 2012, **ex-CEO John Schulte was acquitted on 11 of 12 counts** (including the conspiracy and importation-fraud charges) but was **convicted on one count of lying to federal investigators** about the imported devices【85:1†source】. In May 2012, Schulte was sentenced to **one year of probation and a $5,000 fine**, avoiding prison time for the false statement conviction【85:2†source】. Prosecutors had sought a prison term, but the judge opted for probation given that Schulte had been cleared of the most serious charges. 

As for the other individuals: the former vice president and a business development manager of Spectranetics **had all federal charges against them dropped** or dismissed during the legal proceedings【85:2†source】. A outside consultant, Hernan Ricaurte, **pleaded guilty to a lesser charge** (accessory after the fact, for helping conceal the importation scheme) in 2011. He ultimately received a minimal sentence (reportedly  probation or a few months in jail) as part of his plea deal【85:2†source】. In effect, aside from Schulte’s probationary penalty, the other accused individuals did not end up convicted of wrongdoing in the case.

## Shareholder Class Action and Settlement (2008–2010)

Spectranetics also faced civil litigation from its shareholders as a result of the 2008 investigation. On news of the federal raid and inquiry, **Spectranetics’ stock price plunged nearly 47% in a single day** – falling from around $9.00 to $4.73 per share on September 4, 2008. Investors subsequently filed a **securities class-action lawsuit** accusing the company’s management of deceiving shareholders and inflating the stock’s value by hiding Spectranetics’ regulatory and legal compliance problems. The class action complaint alleged that Spectranetics had failed to disclose its “illicit activities,” which, once revealed by the FDA/ICE raid, caused the stock drop and significant losses for shareholders.

**Allegations:** Specifically, the shareholder lawsuit (consolidated in 2009) claimed that Spectranetics and certain executives had **artificially boosted the company’s financial results** through improper and illegal conduct. The suit alleged that Spectranetics was *improperly marketing, promoting and testing its products (and even third-party devices) for unapproved uses*, while **making payments to physicians** in connection with those unapproved uses. It also asserted that the company **withheld critical data from the FDA** and **lacked effective regulatory compliance controls and adequate internal financial controls**. In essence, investors argued that Spectranetics’ leadership fostered a culture of pushing the envelope with device approvals and physician incentives, which inflated short-term revenues but left the company exposed to regulatory sanctions – a risk that was not disclosed to shareholders.

**Settlement:** Spectranetics moved to resolve the shareholder litigation in mid-2010. In June 2010, the company announced it had agreed to a **$8.5 million cash settlement** to end the class-action lawsuit. (The payout was covered by Spectranetics’ insurers under the terms of the settlement.) In addition, Spectranetics settled a related shareholder **derivative lawsuit** by agreeing to implement certain corporate governance reforms and paying $350,000 in plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees (also paid by insurance),. In exchange for these settlements – which were approved by the U.S. District Court in late 2010 – all claims against the company and its officers/directors regarding the 2007–2008 period were dismissed **with prejudice** (no admission of wrongdoing was made). Spectranetics’ then-CEO Emile Geisenheimer stated that he was pleased to put the litigation behind the company and avoid the expense and distraction of protracted court fights.

## FDA Warning Letter and Device Recalls (2016–2017)

Several years later, Spectranetics encountered new regulatory issues related to the safety of its medical devices. In 2016, the FDA issued a formal **Warning Letter** to Spectranetics following an inspection of the company’s Colorado Springs manufacturing facility in late 2015【85:3†source】. The warning letter (dated May 26, 2016) cited **serious concerns about Spectranetics’ handling of its laser catheter devices used for cardiac lead removal** (specifically the GlideLight Laser Sheath and SLS II Laser Sheath). The FDA noted an alarming number of **patient deaths and adverse events** associated with these devices and found that Spectranetics **failed to adequately evaluate and mitigate the risks**. According to the FDA letter, there had been at least *several* patient deaths reported since 2014 in connection with the GlideLight and SLS II sheaths – yet the company’s risk analysis documentation did not appropriately escalate the severity level of these events, nor fully investigate corrective actions【85:3†source】. In fact, an FDA official wrote that **“there have been at least [redacted] deaths”** and multiple complaints involving these devices, but Spectranetics’ hazard risk assessment remained too low, indicating a deficient understanding of the real-world risks【85:3†source】. 

Furthermore, data in the FDA’s MAUDE safety database underscored the issue. By mid-2016, the MAUDE database showed **hundreds of adverse event reports** for Spectranetics’ lead extraction tools – including on the order of *46 patient deaths associated with the GlideLight laser sheath (and dozens with the SLS II)* in the prior two-year span【85:3†source】. (Historically, over **100 total fatalities** had been reported in connection with these Spectranetics devices up to that time【85:3†source】.) The FDA’s warning letter also identified manufacturing and quality control problems at Spectranetics’ facility. For example, the company had **failed to validate a key manufacturing process** for the laser sheaths’ outer jackets – a failure linked to device malfunctions such as cracked or splitting laser catheters and even instances of **laser light visibly leaking through the device’s outer jacket**【85:3†source】. Additionally, the FDA found that Spectranetics did not adequately implement corrective and preventive action (*CAPA*) procedures or timely quality audits in response to known device issues【85:3†source】. The **warning letter** put Spectranetics on notice that these violations were significant: until corrected, the FDA would not approve any new pre-market applications from Spectranetics related to the affected devices【85:3†source】. (Spectranetics stated in SEC filings that it was working diligently to address the FDA’s findings and that it did not expect any interruption of product supply while fixes were underway【85:3†source】.)

**Device Recalls:** In 2017, Spectranetics had to recall one of its high-profile devices due to a safety defect. In September 2017, the company issued an **urgent recall of approximately 1,900 Bridge Occlusion Balloon Catheters**, after discovering a flaw that could prevent this emergency-use device from functioning properly【85:4†source】. The Bridge Occlusion Balloon is designed to control bleeding by occluding blood vessels during complex lead extraction procedures. The recall notice warned that **some units had a blocked guidewire lumen**, meaning that if a physician tried to deploy the balloon in a patient, the blockage could *impede correct positioning of the catheter and fail to stop hemorrhaging*【85:5†source】. Such a malfunction could delay life-saving treatment for a vascular tear, **potentially resulting in serious injury or death**【85:5†source】. The FDA classified this as a **Class I recall**, its most serious level, given the risk of severe harm【85:5†source】. Spectranetics alerted clinicians in August 2017 to carefully check the device lumen before use and ultimately pulled and replaced the affected lots of the product【85:4†source】.

It’s worth noting that the Bridge Balloon issue was **not an isolated incident** for Spectranetics. The company has experienced multiple product recalls over the years. In fact, at least **nine other Spectranetics device recalls** were reportedly issued between 2010 and 2017 . These included recalls of the Turbo Elite laser atherectomy catheter and the ELCA coronary atherectomy catheter (in those cases, due to packaging defects that potentially compromised device sterility) . The pattern of recalls suggests ongoing challenges with quality control for some Spectranetics products.
