# Top 5 Companies Offering Bundled PC Hardware and Software

In the PC market, certain companies stand out for selling computers (desktops or laptops) that come **bundled** with additional software beyond just the operating system. Such **bundled software** refers to programs pre-installed on a new PC to enhance its functionality out-of-the-box. These often include productivity suites, creative tools, security applications, and more, sparing users from separate installations and providing immediate utility. Below is an in-depth look at five top companies known for robust hardware-software bundles, what they include, and what makes each bundle unique.

## 1. Apple 

Apple’s Mac computers (e.g. MacBook laptops, iMac desktops) are renowned for their tight integration of hardware and software. Every Mac ships with **macOS** plus a rich collection of Apple-developed applications beyond the OS. Notably, Apple includes its full **iWork productivity suite** — **Pages** (word processor), **Numbers** (spreadsheet), and **Keynote** (presentation) — at no extra cost【41:1†source】. These apps serve as capable alternatives to Microsoft Office, giving users the tools to create documents, spreadsheets, and slides from day one【41:1†source】. 

- **Creative Tools Pre-Installed:** In addition to iWork, Macs come with Apple’s **iLife** creative suite. This includes **iMovie** for video editing and **GarageBand** for music creation, alongside **Photos** for image management and editing【41:1†source】. These powerful creative applications are ready to use out-of-the-box, enabling multimedia projects without additional purchases.  
- **Other Bundled Apps:** A new Mac also has many built-in utilities and lifestyle apps. Examples are **FaceTime** and **Messages** for communication, **Safari** browser, **Mail** client, **Preview** for PDF/image editing, **Notes** and **Reminders** for productivity, and more【41:1†source】. Apple’s philosophy is to provide a comprehensive suite covering most users’ needs – from entertainment to productivity – as soon as you power on the machine. 

**What Makes Apple’s Bundle Stand Out:** Apple’s bundled software is developed in-house to work seamlessly with Mac hardware. The integration of macOS with these apps means they are optimized for performance and usability on Macs. Users praise the consistency and polish of Apple’s software ecosystem – for instance, the ability to start a project in iMovie or GarageBand and easily share it across devices. The inclusion of full versions (not trials) of productivity and creative apps adds significant value. Apple’s approach essentially gives buyers a “ready-to-create” environment, which is **especially appealing to students, content creators, and professionals** who can begin working on documents, presentations, photos, or videos immediately【41:1†source】. The tight hardware-software coupling also ensures stability and fewer compatibility issues, fulfilling Apple’s out-of-the-box promise: *“it just works.”*

## 2. Microsoft (Surface) 

Microsoft, known for Windows and Office, also produces the **Surface** line of PCs (Surface Pro tablets, Surface Laptops, Surface Studio, etc.), and it often **bundles its flagship software services with the hardware**. All Surface devices run Windows 11 and typically come with more than just the vanilla OS. A hallmark of Microsoft’s bundles is the inclusion of **Microsoft 365** (formerly Office 365) subscriptions in many Surface packages【41:3†source】. For example, Microsoft offers **Surface “Essentials” bundles** which pair a Surface device with a **Microsoft 365 subscription (Office apps)**, plus additional benefits like an extended warranty (Microsoft Complete) and accessory discounts【41:3†source】. In one such bundle, buyers get a Surface Laptop alongside a 15-month Microsoft 365 plan (enabling Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.) and support services, all at a combined discount【41:3†source】.

- **Productivity Suite:** Bundling **Microsoft 365** is a key differentiator. This gives the user the full Office suite out-of-the-box – Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and more – with cloud storage (OneDrive) and the latest updates【41:3†source】. On some Surface models or promotions, Microsoft has included up to a year of Office 365 Personal in the purchase price, ensuring consumers can be productive immediately【41:4†source】. (For instance, the Surface Laptop at launch came with a one-year Office 365 Personal subscription and 1TB OneDrive storage for a limited time【41:4†source】.)  
- **Integrated Services:** Microsoft often adds other software/services to sweeten the bundle. Many Surface deals include **OneDrive cloud storage**, and newer “Copilot+” Surface PCs come ready for **Windows Copilot AI features** – highlighting AI-driven creativity and productivity enhancements built into Windows 11【41:2†source】. Business-focused Surface SKUs might ship with **Windows 11 Pro** and security tools like BitLocker encryption, aligning with enterprise software needs by default. Microsoft has even offered **Surface All Access** financing bundles that wrap the device, Office 365 for two years, and support into one monthly payment【41:5†source】,【41:5†source】, exemplifying how hardware and software are packaged together.

**What Makes Microsoft’s Bundle Stand Out:** Microsoft controls both the platform and key software, so Surface devices are **optimized for Office and Windows** in performance and features. Pen and touch support on Surfaces is deeply integrated with apps like OneNote and Word, creating a uniquely productive hardware-software synergy. The inclusion of Microsoft 365 means users—from students to professionals—can start working or creating immediately with industry-standard tools. Microsoft’s bundles also often emphasize **support and security** (with plans like Microsoft Complete or Windows Hello biometrics pre-configured), ensuring a fully equipped experience. Overall, Microsoft leverages its software ecosystem in these bundles to deliver a **turnkey productivity machine**, which is especially attractive to those who live in Office apps or need a secure, work-ready device on day one【41:5†source】.

## 3. Dell

Dell is a top PC manufacturer whose desktops (like the XPS, Inspiron, and Alienware gaming towers) and laptops (XPS, Latitude, etc.) frequently come with extra software beyond Windows. **Dell’s bundled offerings** typically include a mix of third-party software (for security and productivity) and Dell’s own utilities. For consumer models, it’s common to find an **antivirus suite pre-installed** – Dell often ships systems with either a free trial or a complementary 12-month subscription of **McAfee LiveSafe** security software built into the purchase . In fact, Dell normally includes either a trial or a fully paid year of McAfee with new PCs, so users have antivirus protection from the start . Alongside that, most Dell PCs also have a **trial version of Microsoft Office** (e.g. a 30-day Microsoft 365 trial) preloaded, which can be activated or upgraded per the user’s choice【41:4†source】. This saves time for users who need Office immediately, even if a purchase or subscription is required after the trial. 

- **Productivity and Security Software:** A typical new Dell will come with **Windows 11** plus a few key extras: a **Microsoft Office trial** (often 30 days of Office 365 apps) and antivirus/security software. For example, one Dell XPS desktop package explicitly included a 12-month McAfee LiveSafe subscription and a 30-day Office trial pre-installed. Dell also preloads utilities like **SupportAssist** (for system diagnostics and driver updates) and **Dell Mobile Connect** (for phone-PC integration), aiming to enhance the user experience. These are part of Dell’s effort to *“provide essential tools and functionalities”* to users from the first boot, as is the general industry practice with bundled software.  
- **Creative and Specialized Software:** Beyond the standard trialware, Dell has at times bundled full versions of creative or specialized software with its premium PCs. A notable example was the **Dell XPS 420 multimedia desktop**, which came with an exclusive **Adobe Elements Studio** suite pre-installed – including Adobe Photoshop Elements 6, Premiere Elements 4, and Soundbooth CS3【41:6†source】. This bundle was tailored for content creators, giving them photo, video, and audio editing tools out-of-the-box. Dell also certifies many of its higher-end workstations with professional software (ISV certifications) to ensure compatibility and offers options to include tools like data recovery software or cloud backups with new systems.

**What Makes Dell’s Bundle Stand Out:** Dell’s approach is about offering a **comprehensive setup that can be customized to user needs**. They provide the basics (Office trial, security) to every user and often allow customization at purchase – for instance, buyers can opt to include a full Office license or specialized software at a discounted rate during configuration. This flexibility, combined with occasional value-adds (like the Adobe bundle on an XPS or promotions for software like **Adobe Creative Cloud or antivirus deals** on Dell’s online store), means consumers can get a PC tailored to their use case. Dell’s business lineup similarly might come with Windows Pro and management tools preloaded for IT, while gaming systems might bundle game demos or GPU software. Ultimately, Dell stands out by providing **ready-to-go productivity and protection** for mainstream users and offering **niche software bundles for specific audiences** (creators, gamers, professionals) when it adds value. The result is a PC package where hardware and software together deliver a fuller experience than just the bare Windows OS.

## 4. HP (Hewlett-Packard)

HP is another leading PC maker known for bundling a variety of software with its desktops and laptops. An **HP computer** typically comes with **Windows** plus a suite of both HP’s own applications and third-party programs installed. HP’s first-boot experience usually includes helpful in-house tools like **HP Support Assistant, HP Recovery Manager, power management utilities, and printing/photo software**【41:7†source】. For example, HP traditionally loaded apps such as *HP Wireless Assistant, HP Photo Creations, HP Games (WildTangent), and HP Setup* on new PCs【41:7†source】 – all aimed at making device setup and using peripherals easier. Alongside these, HP has historically included third-party essentials: every HP comes with Adobe Reader (for PDFs) pre-installed, and in the past Adobe Flash was included as well【41:7†source】 (though Flash is now obsolete). 

- **Office 365 and Productivity:** HP often **bundles Microsoft Office offers** with its consumer laptops, which is a big draw for students and office workers. Many HP laptop models (especially in the mid-range Stream and Pavilion series) come with **Microsoft 365 Personal** **pre-installed and activated for 1 year** as part of the purchase【41:8†source】. For instance, one HP 14-inch notebook is advertised as *“HP laptop with Microsoft Office 365 Included,”* meaning it comes with a one-year Personal subscription preloaded – giving the user Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, and Access right away【41:8†source】. If a full year isn’t included, HP at least provides a trial of Office (30 days) on most models, ensuring continuity if the user chooses to subscribe. This bundling of Office out-of-the-box is a significant convenience, effectively saving the buyer the step of acquiring productivity software separately.  
- **Security Software:** Just as with other vendors, HP includes antivirus/security trials on its systems. Traditionally, HP has partnered with **Norton** for security – new HP PCs often have a trial of **Norton Internet Security** preloaded【41:7†source】. Users are given options to extend that protection with discounted offers at purchase time. (As of 2011, for example, HP offered buyers the option to upgrade to 15-month, 2-year, or 3-year Norton subscriptions at a reduced price when configuring a new PC【41:7†source】.) Today, HP’s consumer machines sometimes come with **McAfee LiveSafe** trials similarly. Additionally, HP’s business-class notebooks come with the company’s **Wolf Security** suite (including features like Sure Click and Sure Start) built into the software image for advanced malware protection at no extra charge – highlighting HP’s emphasis on endpoint security.

**What Makes HP’s Bundle Stand Out:** HP’s bundled offering is broad and **user-friendly for non-technical users**, providing a lot of tools upfront. The inclusion of a full year of Microsoft 365 on many models is a strong selling point, as it immediately equips users for work or school without extra cost【41:8†source】. HP also differentiates itself with its **proprietary software**: for instance, HP’s audio drivers often come with custom tuning (Bang & Olufsen audio control software on Spectre/Pavilion lines), and **HP QuickDrop** comes pre-installed to easily transfer files between PC and phone. These extras enhance the daily experience. Moreover, HP caters to both ends of the spectrum: casual users get games and photo software to play with, whereas business users on HP EliteBooks or ZBooks get security and manageability software built-in. The **sheer variety of bundled apps** – from trial software to full versions and utilities – means an HP PC is ready for a range of activities (web browsing, editing documents, media playback, basic photo editing, etc.) as soon as it’s unboxed【41:7†source】. This “kitchen sink” approach stands out in that **HP PC owners can often avoid downloading a lot of common apps manually**; they’re either already there or a short setup away, streamlining the setup process.

## 5. Lenovo

Lenovo, the world’s largest PC vendor, delivers a bundled software experience that balances **useful tools with flexibility**. Lenovo’s product lines (ThinkPad, ThinkBook, IdeaPad, Yoga, Legion gaming, etc.) all ship with Windows and a selection of bundled applications. Out-of-the-box, a Lenovo will usually have **Lenovo’s own management software** such as **Lenovo Vantage** (for system updates, driver downloads, and hardware settings) and **Lenovo Utility** programs (e.g. for keyboard hotkeys or power management). These help users optimize system performance and keep their device updated effortlessly. Like other top vendors, Lenovo also includes standard third-party offerings: expect an **Office trial** and some form of **antivirus trial** on most consumer models,. In regions like North America and Europe, Lenovo often preloads a 30-day **Microsoft 365 trial**, whereas in some markets (e.g. Asia) certain Lenovo models even come with a **full Office Home & Student license** included in the price (providing Word, Excel, PowerPoint perpetually). In fact, many of Lenovo’s premium and business laptops commonly come with Office of some form pre-installed.

- **Examples of Bundled Software:** A practical example is the **Lenovo Yoga series** (convertible 2-in-1 laptops). The **Yoga 7i** has been noted to often ship with a bundled **Microsoft Office installation** ready to go. That means a buyer can sign into Office on first launch and immediately use Word/Excel without needing to download anything. Similarly, Lenovo’s flagship business notebooks, the **ThinkPad** series, frequently include productivity and security software out-of-box – these machines might come with **Windows 11 Pro**, a suite of security tools (TPM encryption, fingerprint software), and sometimes a pre-installed Office suite given their target audience of professionals. Lenovo also pre-installs **PowerDVD** or similar media players for DVD models, **McAfee LiveSafe** on many consumer IdeaPads, and applications like **LinkedIn** or **Dropbox promotions** as part of the factory image, covering communication and cloud storage needs.  
- **User Choice and Customization:** Lenovo emphasizes user choice in the bundled software experience. Their documentation explains that bundled programs (antivirus, productivity tools, media players, etc.) are provided to streamline the experience, but users **have the flexibility to customize or remove them** during initial setup or later,. For instance, on first boot, a Lenovo PC might prompt which preloaded apps you want to enable. This approach avoids unwanted bloat while still offering convenience. Lenovo even had an **App Explorer** in the past, allowing users to install recommended apps at will instead of forcing them. This philosophy ensures that while Lenovo PCs come equipped with plenty of functionality out-of-the-box, the **user remains in control** of their software environment.

**What Makes Lenovo’s Bundle Stand Out:** Lenovo’s bundles are known for being **practical and business-oriented**. ThinkPads, in particular, are often ready for work on day one with minimal tweaking – if a company is setting them up, the presence of Office (or at least the easy option to activate it) and security software means less time provisioning software. The **combination of Lenovo’s robust system tools and standard productivity apps** ensures a new Lenovo PC can be productive and secure immediately. Another standout aspect is Lenovo’s relative restraint and **focus on essential utilities**: outside of the necessary trials (which are industry-standard), Lenovo doesn’t overload machines with frivolous apps. The included software is generally there to add value (like Dolby Vision/Atmos apps to optimize display or audio on supported models, or **Glance** eye-tracking software on certain models for security). This careful curation, plus the option to opt out of things during setup, has earned Lenovo a good reputation regarding bloatware management. In summary, Lenovo offers **well-rounded bundles that cater to both everyday consumers and professionals**, with a lean towards productivity and user empowerment.

---

**Conclusion:** Each of these top companies – Apple, Microsoft, Dell, HP, and Lenovo – adds their own flavor of software bundling to their hardware offerings. All include more than just an OS: whether it’s Apple providing a creativity suite for free, Microsoft combining hardware with Office 365 and AI features, or Windows PC makers adding security and productivity tools to jump-start the user’s experience. These bundles make the computers more immediately useful and highlight each company’s strengths: **Apple’s ecosystem of apps**, **Microsoft’s productivity suite**, **Dell’s customization for user needs**, **HP’s all-in-one convenience**, and **Lenovo’s professional-ready setups**. For buyers, understanding these bundled offerings is important because they contribute to the overall value of the PC – often saving money (no need to buy certain software separately) and time. Ultimately, a bundled hardware-software package can provide a **seamless, out-of-the-box experience**, with these companies leading the way in crafting integrated solutions for consumers and businesses alike.,
