# Top 5 PC Hardware & Software Bundling Companies

In 2025, several leading PC manufacturers distinguish themselves by offering **bundled hardware and software packages** that go beyond just an operating system. These bundles typically include **PC hardware** paired with value-added software like productivity suites, security tools, or creative applications. Such offerings give users a convenient, out-of-the-box solution for work, creativity, or security needs. Below are the **top five companies** known for providing robust PC-plus-software bundles, along with what they include and why they stand out, backed by recent sources.

## 1. Dell Technologies  
**Overview of Offerings:** Dell provides comprehensive PC bundles that often combine their hardware (like **XPS** and **Latitude** laptops or **Inspiron** desktops) with additional software beyond Windows. Notably, Dell partners with Microsoft and Intel to package systems with **Windows 11** and **Microsoft 365** productivity suites for a ready-to-work setup【52:2†source】. Many Dell PCs also come pre-loaded with security software (e.g., **McAfee LiveSafe** trials) to protect users from day one. For instance, Dell’s small-business “Complete IT Solutions” bundles marry Intel-powered PCs with Windows 11 and Microsoft 365, emphasizing productivity and built-in security features【52:2†source】. 

**Why Dell Stands Out:** Dell is known for its **end-to-end solutions** approach. It not only sells hardware but also includes the software and services needed for a seamless experience. Dell’s bundles often include **ProSupport** services and device management tools, which appeal to business users looking for reliability and support. By packaging top-rated software (Office apps, cloud storage, security tools) with their PCs, Dell helps customers save time and costs while ensuring versatile workflows that **maximize productivity without compromising security**【52:2†source】. This commitment to bundled value and support has made Dell a preferred choice for professionals seeking a one-stop computing solution.

## 2. Hewlett Packard (HP)  
**Overview of Offerings:** HP, another leading PC maker, frequently bundles its **Pavilion**, **Envy**, and **Elite** series PCs with extra software that adds value beyond the Windows OS. Many HP laptops and desktops include promotions like a **free one-year Microsoft 365** subscription (formerly Office 365) for personal use. This gives buyers immediate access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and 1 TB of OneDrive storage without additional cost. HP also emphasizes security in its bundles: new HP computers commonly come with **antivirus suites pre-installed** (often a trial of McAfee LiveSafe or similar) as part of an agreement to provide “immediate access to essential security features”【52:3†source】. For example, HP has preloaded McAfee LiveSafe on many new consumer and commercial PCs, underscoring its focus on user data protection【52:3†source】.

**Why HP Stands Out:** HP differentiates itself by offering **all-in-one package deals** that often include not just the PC and software, but sometimes peripherals (monitors or printers) for a complete home/office setup. Bundling productivity software like Office boosts a new PC’s usefulness from day one, which is especially attractive to students and small businesses. Additionally, HP’s strong focus on security – evident in features like **HP Wolf Security** on business-class PCs – means customers get hardware reinforced by software defenses. By providing popular software (e.g. Office apps or security tools) out-of-the-box, HP delivers convenience and peace of mind. This **combination of hardware, software, and services** in a single package has solidified HP’s reputation as a one-stop solution for PC buyers seeking immediate productivity and security.

## 3. Lenovo  
**Overview of Offerings:** Lenovo, the world’s largest PC manufacturer by unit share, leverages its scale to include valuable software with its hardware. Many Lenovo PCs come with more than just Windows – for instance, select **IdeaPad** laptops have been offered with **one free year of Microsoft Office 365** included, granting full access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and more during that period. Across Lenovo’s product lines (IdeaPad, **ThinkPad**, **Yoga**, etc.), it’s common to find pre-installed trials of productivity and security software. Lenovo often includes an antivirus/security suite (such as McAfee) on new machines to ensure users have immediate protection . In fact, even high-end Lenovo models (like the ThinkPad series or innovative devices) usually ship with a trial security package enabled, reflecting an industry trend to safeguard PCs out-of-box . Lenovo’s own software, like the **Lenovo Vantage** app, also comes bundled to help with system updates and performance tuning, enhancing the hardware-software integration.

**Why Lenovo Stands Out:** Lenovo is known for its **enterprise-grade solutions** and often integrates **ThinkShield** security features (firmware and software-level protections) into its PCs for business users. By bundling software such as Office 365 trials or subscriptions, Lenovo PCs enable customers to be productive immediately upon setup – a useful perk for both consumers and corporate deployments. The inclusion of security trials reflects Lenovo’s commitment to user security, aligning with its image of reliable ThinkPad laptops used in corporate environments. Moreover, Lenovo’s breadth of offerings (from affordable IdeaPads to premium ThinkStations) means they deliver appropriate software bundles for each segment – e.g. student-focused models might bundle Office or education apps, while creative-oriented models may come with multimedia software. This ability to provide **tailored hardware with relevant software** has helped Lenovo maintain its top spot in the PC market. Customers appreciate that a Lenovo PC often comes ready to go with the essential tools for work or study already in place, .

## 4. Microsoft (Surface Devices)  
**Overview of Offerings:** Microsoft’s Surface line exemplifies a tightly integrated hardware-software bundle. When you buy a **Microsoft Surface PC** (such as the Surface Laptop or Surface Pro tablet), Microsoft often includes its flagship software as part of the deal. For example, Microsoft sells **Surface “Essentials Bundles”** which combine the device with a **Microsoft 365** subscription and other services,【52:1†source】. This means the Surface comes with premium Office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.) plus 1 TB OneDrive cloud storage ready to use【52:1†source】. In addition, Microsoft sometimes bundles accessories or extended support plans (Microsoft Complete) at a discount in these packages,. All Surface devices run **Windows 11**, and Microsoft leverages unique Windows features (like the new **Windows Copilot AI**) to enhance the hardware’s capabilities. The result is a PC that’s optimized for Microsoft’s productivity ecosystem out-of-the-box, with no need to purchase or install key applications separately.

**Why Microsoft Stands Out:** As the creator of Windows and Office, Microsoft’s advantage is **vertical integration**. Surface computers are designed alongside the software, so the user experience is exceptionally seamless – from the first boot, the machine is synchronized with the user’s Microsoft account, Office apps are ready to activate, and OneDrive can automatically sync files. The inclusion of Microsoft 365 in bundles is a significant value-add; it ensures users have the full Microsoft productivity suite and cloud services at their fingertips【52:1†source】. Microsoft’s bundles also often include **advanced support** or device protection, reflecting confidence in their hardware quality. While Microsoft’s share in PC hardware is smaller than that of Dell or HP, the **Surface bundles’ quality** is frequently praised for how well hardware and software complement each other. In essence, Microsoft stands out by offering a **premium, productivity-focused experience** – a Surface bundle equips users with cutting-edge hardware plus the latest Office tools and AI-enhanced Windows features, all in one package.

## 5. Apple (Mac Computers)  
**Overview of Offerings:** Apple’s Macs are renowned for coming bundled with a rich collection of Apple-developed software in addition to macOS. Every new **MacBook, iMac, or Mac Mini** includes Apple’s full **iWork productivity suite** and **iLife creative apps** at no extra charge. This means users have **Pages** (word processor), **Numbers** (spreadsheet), and **Keynote** (presentations) pre-installed for productivity, which are Apple’s equivalents to Microsoft’s Office apps. On the creative side, Macs also come with **iMovie** for video editing and **GarageBand** for music creation already installed. These apps are not time-limited trials, but the full versions, and Apple made them free for all Mac owners. Additionally, macOS includes robust built-in software like **Photos**, **FaceTime**, and **Safari**, providing a well-rounded experience from the start. Apple sometimes offers limited-time subscriptions to services (like Apple TV+ or iCloud storage) with new devices, but the key draw is that a Mac’s essential creative and productivity tools are **bundled as part of the purchase**.

**Why Apple Stands Out:** Apple’s approach to bundling is unique in that all the software it includes is **first-party and optimized for the hardware**. This tight integration means the macOS environment and apps like iMovie or Pages run exceptionally smoothly on Apple’s hardware (especially on the latest Apple **M-series chips**). Users can literally unbox a Mac and begin writing documents, crunching numbers, editing photos/videos, or recording music without needing additional purchases. The value of these included apps is significant – for example, Apple’s Pages, Numbers, and Keynote were once paid software, but since 2013 Apple has made them free with every Mac, reflecting its philosophy of delivering the best experience **out-of-the-box**. Apple stands out for its **ecosystem cohesion**: the bundled apps also sync via iCloud across a user’s iPhone and iPad, creating a seamless multi-device experience. In summary, Apple’s hardware-software bundles excel in creativity and productivity offerings, and this all-in-one ecosystem approach is a major reason Apple retains a loyal customer base looking for a complete solution in one purchase.

**Sources:** Recent industry reports and official product information were used to verify these rankings and offerings. Dell and HP’s bundling of Windows 11, Office 365, and security tools are confirmed by their official small business solution pages and support forums【52:2†source】,. Lenovo’s inclusion of free Office 365 trials and pre-loaded security software on new PCs has been highlighted in tech deal news and reviews, . Microsoft’s Surface bundle details (with Microsoft 365 and support plan) are documented on Microsoft’s own store description【52:1†source】. Apple’s bundled Mac software is detailed on Apple’s site, which notes that iMovie, GarageBand, and the iWork apps come free with every Mac. These examples illustrate why these five companies lead in offering compelling hardware-software packages for consumers and professionals alike.
