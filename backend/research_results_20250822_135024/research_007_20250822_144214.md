# Latest News on Pugh Capital Management

**Pugh Capital Management**—a Seattle-based institutional fixed-income investment firm—has recently made headlines through significant business expansion and industry recognition. Below are the key developments and announcements concerning the firm in the past year or so, along with summarized details and sources:

## Expansion via High-Yield Acquisition (2025)

- **Major Acquisition:** In April 2025, Pugh Capital **acquired the U.S. high-yield investment business of SKY Harbor Capital Management**, a move that substantially expanded its assets and product offerings【44:1†source】. SKY Harbor’s high-yield team was a women-led group founded by Hannah Strasser and Anne Yobage【44:1†source】, and this acquisition enabled Pugh Capital to offer high-yield fixed-income strategies for the first time.  
- **Asset Growth:** The deal added **over $2 billion** in high-yield assets to Pugh Capital’s portfolio, **bringing the firm’s total assets under management (AUM) to approximately $13.2 billion**. This represents a significant increase in scale for the firm’s investment operations.  
- **Expanded Team:** Along with asset growth, Pugh Capital’s **headcount grew from 26 to 38 employees** as a result of the acquisition. The integration of SKY Harbor’s specialists boosted Pugh Capital’s in-house expertise in credit research and portfolio management, positioning the combined firm for broader fixed-income capabilities【44:1†source】.

## Inclusion in PBGC’s Manager Program (2024)

- **Federal Program Participation:** In January 2024, Pugh Capital was **selected by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)** as one of six firms to join PBGC’s **Smaller Asset Managers Program**. This program is designed to reduce barriers for smaller and diverse asset management firms by allowing them to manage a portion of PBGC’s pension assets.  
- **Role & Significance:** As a participant in the program, Pugh Capital helps manage part of PBGC’s **U.S. core fixed-income portfolio**, which includes government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate bonds. Notably, Pugh Capital had been part of the pilot version of this program and was invited again now that the program is a permanent initiative. This inclusion underscores the firm’s capability and track record, as PBGC holds all managers (large or small) to the same performance and risk-management standards.

## Community and Industry Recognition

- **Corporate Citizenship Award:** Pugh Capital’s community engagement efforts earned it local recognition in 2025. The **Puget Sound Business Journal (PSBJ)** announced that Pugh Capital would be **honored among 12 Seattle-area companies in its 2025 Corporate Citizenship Awards**【44:2†source】. This annual program highlights businesses that give back to their communities, and Pugh Capital’s inclusion reflects its philanthropic contributions and commitment to social responsibility. *(The PSBJ Corporate Citizenship Awards were scheduled to be presented in May 2025.)*  
- **Leadership Accolades:** The firm’s leadership also received noteworthy accolades. **Mary Pugh**, the founder and CEO of Pugh Capital, was **named to PSBJ’s “Power 100” list of top executives** (2022 edition, awarded in 2023) . This distinction identified her as one of the region’s most influential business leaders. Such recognition of Mary Pugh – who leads one of the largest African American-owned asset management firms in the country – underscores both her professional impact and Pugh Capital’s prominence in the industry.
