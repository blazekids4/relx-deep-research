# Economic Development Incentives by California Utilities

## Introduction  
California’s major utilities have developed **economic development incentive programs** to attract and retain customers, spur job creation, and support state policy goals. These programs range from special discounted **electricity rates** for businesses that expand or relocate in California, to **clean energy incentives** that encourage adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles. Such initiatives are typically approved and overseen by state regulators (the California Public Utilities Commission, CPUC) in partnership with economic development agencies to ensure they benefit the broader economy and utility ratepayers. Below is a detailed overview of key programs offered by utilities like PG&E, Southern California Edison, and SDG&E – including their features, eligibility criteria, and objectives – as well as examples of **green energy incentive programs** targeting sustainable growth.

## Economic Development Rate (EDR) Programs in California  
California’s investor-owned electric utilities offer **Economic Development Rates (EDRs)** – discounted electricity tariffs designed to make doing business in California more affordable for energy-intensive companies. The goal of EDR tariffs is to **retain or attract large business customers** (and the jobs they provide) that might otherwise leave the state or expand elsewhere. In practice, an EDR provides an eligible company with a significant **percentage discount on its electric bills for a fixed period** (usually five years) as an incentive to locate, expand, or stay in the utility’s service area. These special rates come with requirements to ensure they truly drive economic development (such as job creation commitments and third-party verification of need). Below we outline the EDR programs of the three large electric utilities in California:

### Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) – Economic Development Rate  
PG&E’s Economic Development Rate offers qualifying businesses substantial electricity cost reductions for up to five years. **Industrial, processing, and manufacturing businesses** – particularly those with high energy use – are the primary targets for this program【52:1†source】. PG&E provides three tiers of discounted rates under the EDR: a standard **12% rate reduction**, and enhanced options of **18% or up to 25%** off, depending on location and economic conditions,. The higher-tier discounts are available in areas with high unemployment, reflecting a policy focus on encouraging investment in economically distressed regions. 

**Eligibility & Conditions:** To qualify, a business must add or retain a significant electrical load in PG&E’s territory – generally at least **150 kW of demand** representing new or saved load for California. Companies must be **considering out-of-state options** (e.g. relocating a facility to another state, or choosing a new expansion site outside California) or be at risk of shutting down operations in California【52:4†source】. The EDR discount is essentially a tool to tip the decision in California’s favor (“but for” the rate, the business would not stay or locate here). Applicants need to submit an EDR application demonstrating their need, and the **Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz)** independently reviews large applications to validate that the incentive is crucial to the business’s decision【52:4†source】. Participants must also **commit to creating or retaining jobs** as a result of the discount. In fact, PG&E developed the EDR explicitly “to help businesses grow or maintain jobs” in the state【52:1†source】. When a company is approved, it signs an EDR agreement and receives the discounted rate on its electric bills for a five-year term, as long as it meets the agreed load and job targets. For example, in Fresno County (a high-unemployment area), eligible businesses can receive the **enhanced 25% rate reduction** on electricity for five years under PG&E’s EDR program, provided they have at least 150 kW load and were weighing other states or closure【52:4†source】. This can significantly lower operating costs and was designed to encourage companies to **locate, stay, or expand in California** rather than elsewhere【52:4†source】.

### Southern California Edison (SCE) – Economic Development Rate  
Southern California Edison (SCE) similarly offers an Economic Development Rate to support business growth in its service territory. SCE’s EDR provides a **12% discount on electricity bills for a 5-year period** to qualifying businesses【52:3†source】. The program’s purpose is to **attract new businesses, retain those at risk of leaving, and encourage expansions** in Southern California **instead of out-of-state** locations【52:3†source】. SCE originally had a program cap (e.g. 200 MW of enrolled load) and a limited enrollment window tied to regulatory approval, but the program was *re-authorized* in 2019 to continue offering discounts to new applicants【52:3†source】.

**Eligibility & Requirements:** SCE’s standard criteria require a minimum load of **150 kW** in order to qualify for the EDR discount (though special provisions exist to accommodate some smaller businesses)【52:3†source】. Only **non-residential, non-governmental** customers are eligible. A business must demonstrate a “**critical need**” for the rate – typically by providing a business case showing that without the discount, it has a **viable out-of-state alternative** or would need to downsize/close its California operations【52:3†source】. SCE’s Economic Development Services team conducts an independent review of each application, and the company must sign an affidavit attesting that **“but for” the EDR, it would not retain or add that electric load in California**【52:3†source】. In other words, the discount has to be a determining factor in keeping the business (and its jobs and energy usage) in the state. The EDR is open to SCE’s bundled service customers as well as those served by Direct Access or Community Choice aggregators (in which case the discount applies to the delivery portion of the bill). For businesses under the 150 kW threshold, SCE has **additional options** or modified criteria, acknowledging that smaller enterprises may also face relocation pressures【52:3†source】. Overall, SCE’s program aligns with the same objectives as PG&E’s – using targeted rate reductions to improve California’s competitiveness for business, thereby **stimulating local investment and job growth**【52:3†source】.

### San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) – Economic Development Rate  
San Diego Gas & Electric’s Economic Development Rate was modeled after the PG&E and SCE programs and launched with the aim of bolstering the San Diego regional economy. **Eligible businesses can receive a 12% discount** on the electric portion of their monthly bills for **five years** under SDG&E’s EDR【52:2†source】. SDG&E explicitly frames this as a partnership to “empower your business” – the utility recognizes that helping companies grow will lead to **job creation in the community**【52:2†source】. The EDR is intended to **attract businesses from outside California, retain those that might leave, and support expansions** by existing local companies【52:2†source】, thereby keeping economic activity (and electrical load) in the San Diego area.

**Eligibility & Program Details:** SDG&E’s EDR is open to **non-residential, non-government customers** that meet one of the following scenarios: a business considering **relocating out of California**, a business that would **cease operations in California “but for” the discount**, or a business **relocating into SDG&E’s territory from out-of-state**【52:2†source】. All three cases focus on situations where the company’s decision to operate in California hangs in the balance【52:2†source】. Like the other utilities, SDG&E requires participants to **sign an affidavit** affirming that the EDR incentive is a key factor in their decision to stay or move to the area【52:2†source】. Companies also agree to **create and/or retain jobs** in California as a condition of the rate discount【52:2†source】. There is a minimum load requirement: businesses must have at least **150 kW of demand** to be subject to full review; smaller businesses (≤150 kW demand) can still qualify but are handled via a simpler affidavit process【52:2†source】. Uniquely, SDG&E’s program set aside a portion of its capacity specifically for smaller businesses – of the program’s **40 MW total cap**, up to 10 MW is reserved for customers 150 kW or below, and 30 MW for larger customers【52:2†source】. Applications from large customers (>150 kW) are reviewed in coordination with **GO-Biz**, the state economic development office, which must approve those projects to ensure the discount is justified【52:2†source】. This safeguard aligns with state law requiring that other ratepayers benefit from economic development programs. Once approved, the business signs an EDR agreement and begins receiving the **12% bill discount for 60 months**【52:2†source】. SDG&E emphasizes that if they can help a company grow via lower energy costs, that company in turn will “create more jobs in our community” – underscoring the **job growth objective** behind the incentive【52:2†source】.

**Ratepayer Protections:** It’s worth noting that all these EDR programs include measures to protect other ratepayers and ensure net benefits. The discounts are often limited in scope (caps on total megawatts or limited enrollment periods) and require validation that the incentivized load would truly be lost or not gained without the program. The CPUC, in approving EDR tariffs, stipulated that the broader body of customers should **ultimately benefit** – for example, through a stronger local economy, a larger customer base sharing fixed utility costs, or avoidance of revenue loss that would occur if a large customer left the system. In practice, these programs have been used selectively to secure major investments or prevent plant closures. By design, **economic development rates trade a short-term revenue discount for longer-term economic and community gains** (jobs, tax base, and potentially more electric demand than would otherwise exist).

## Supporting Green Energy Adoption and Other Incentive Programs  
Beyond traditional economic development rates aimed at businesses, California utilities also administer a variety of **programs to encourage clean energy adoption, energy efficiency, and customer affordability**. These incentives serve the dual purpose of advancing the state’s environmental goals (such as greenhouse gas reduction) and often have economic development co-benefits, like fostering new industries (e.g. electric vehicles or solar) and reducing energy costs for consumers. Key examples include:

- **Electric Vehicle (EV) Incentives and Rates:**  California sees transportation electrification as a major opportunity for both climate benefits and economic stimulus. Utilities are actively supporting this transition. For instance, PG&E offers rebates and rate programs to make EV ownership more affordable – including a **Pre-Owned EV Rebate Program** that provides up to **$4,000** to income-qualified customers who purchase a used electric car , . As of early 2025, PG&E had issued over 13,000 such rebates (over $29 million in funds) and still had $50 million available for new applicants . Additionally, PG&E (and likewise SCE and SDG&E) provide special **EV rate plans** that offer lower electricity prices during off-peak hours, so drivers can charge their vehicles economically – in some cases equivalent to paying about $1.88 per gallon of gas when charging at night on a discounted plan . These programs aim to **accelerate EV adoption** (especially among lower-income customers) by reducing upfront and operating costs, thus supporting growth of the EV market while also expanding the utility customer base. More EVs on the grid can even put downward pressure on rates in the long run by spreading fixed grid costs across more electricity sales . SCE and SDG&E have similar initiatives, such as SCE’s “Charge Ready” infrastructure program which funds the installation of charging stations at businesses, schools and public locations. By reducing barriers to EV deployment, the utilities are helping create a **clean transportation ecosystem** that brings new investment (e.g. charging equipment, services, and manufacturing jobs) to California.

- **Renewable Energy and Microgrid Grants:** Utilities are also incentivizing the development of local clean energy projects that improve community resilience. A notable example is **PG&E’s Microgrid Incentive Program (MIP)**, a newly launched initiative funded through CPUC programs. In March 2025, PG&E announced **$43 million in grant funding** to support nine new **community microgrids** in Northern and Central California【52:5†source】. These microgrids – which will use distributed energy resources like solar panels, battery storage, and other clean generators – are targeted at **disadvantaged communities vulnerable to outages**, such as rural and tribal areas that face frequent wildfire-related power shutoffs【52:5†source】. By financing a portion of the infrastructure (including up to 100% of the cost of solar+battery systems for the community projects), the program helps these communities develop their own local energy resilience hubs. This not only promotes **green energy adoption** at the local level but also has economic benefits: the construction and operation of microgrids can create local jobs, and avoiding lengthy outages helps local businesses (for example, keeping critical facilities like food markets and manufacturing running during grid emergencies). Other utilities are pursuing similar resiliency and clean energy programs in their regions, often in partnership with state and federal grants. These efforts demonstrate how **economic development and clean energy goals intersect** – e.g. building modern energy infrastructure in a community can attract new businesses and investment to that area while advancing climate objectives.

- **Energy Efficiency and Demand Response Programs:** All major California utilities run extensive **energy efficiency rebate programs** and offer **demand response incentives**, which indirectly support economic development by lowering customers’ operating costs and spurring a market for efficiency services and technologies. For example, SCE’s Economic Development Services group will often help businesses tap into existing incentive programs such as **Savings By Design** (an energy-efficient building design program), retrofitting rebates, or **on-bill financing** for efficiency upgrades. These incentives allow companies to invest in modernizing their facilities (lighting, HVAC, industrial processes) with the utility offsetting part of the cost, resulting in ongoing energy savings. Lower energy bills improve a company’s bottom line, potentially freeing up capital for expansion or hiring. Similarly, **demand response programs** pay commercial customers to curtail energy use during peak demand periods or grid stress events, in exchange for bill credits or payments. This not only enhances grid reliability but effectively provides an **economic incentive** for businesses to be flexible in their operations. Taken together, efficiency and demand response programs help maintain California’s leadership in clean energy while giving businesses tools to manage and reduce their energy expenses – a win-win that drives **sustainable economic growth**.

- **Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP):** Another long-running initiative is the **Self-Generation Incentive Program**, administered by the utilities under CPUC oversight. SGIP offers **substantial rebates for installing on-site energy systems** such as **battery storage** and other distributed generation. For instance, businesses (or homes) that add battery storage can receive incentives in the range of hundreds of dollars per kilowatt-hour of storage capacity, which can cover a significant portion of the cost of a backup battery system,. The program originally aimed to encourage peak-load reduction and innovation in distributed generation; today it has a focus on storage (especially for resiliency and reducing peak fossil fuel generation). By participating, commercial customers not only improve their energy reliability (important for economic continuity during outages), but also help the state meet clean energy targets. SGIP funds have spurred a local industry of energy solution providers and made California a leading market for advanced energy storage technology. In economic terms, this translates to **investment in clean tech and associated jobs** while also enabling individual customers to save on energy costs (for example, by using stored energy to avoid expensive peak rates or keep operations running through blackouts).

- **Customer Rate Assistance Programs:** While not traditionally labeled as “economic development,” California’s utilities also implement **reduced-rate programs for certain customer groups** to support affordability – which has broad socio-economic benefits. Notably, the **CARE (California Alternate Rates for Energy)** and **FERA (Family Electric Rate Assistance)** programs provide income-qualified households with discounts of about 30–35% and 18% on their utility bills, respectively. These discounts, mandated by state policy and funded through utility rates, **target low-income customers** to ensure energy bills remain manageable. Keeping energy affordable for vulnerable populations has an indirect economic development effect: it increases disposable income in low-income communities (which can then be spent in the local economy) and helps stabilize those households. For example, PG&E in 2025 expanded eligibility for its FERA 18%-discount program to an additional ~150,000 customers under new guidelines. By **providing reduced rates** to those who need it most, utilities help improve equity and quality of life, which is an important component of sustainable economic development in California. 

## Conclusion  
California’s utilities employ a multifaceted approach to economic development through targeted incentives. **Utility economic development rates** (like PG&E’s, SCE’s, and SDG&E’s EDR programs) are key tools to attract or retain large employers by offsetting one of the state’s historically high costs – energy. These programs require participants to demonstrate tangible commitments (such as job creation or retained operations) in return for **temporary rate relief**【52:2†source】,【52:2†source】, aligning the incentives with public benefits. At the same time, utilities are **driving investment in green technologies** by offering rebates and special rates for clean energy adoption – from electric vehicles to battery storage – which supports new industries and helps meet California’s aggressive climate goals ,【52:5†source】. Under the oversight of state agencies like the CPUC and GO-Biz, these initiatives strive to balance the needs of customers and the economy with the interests of ratepayers and environmental objectives. The overall strategy is clear: by leveraging rate incentives and programs, California’s utilities are not just energy providers but partners in **economic growth and sustainability**, helping to keep businesses in-state, facilitating innovative projects, and making cleaner energy more accessible for all. 

**Sources:** Official utility program documents and announcements, CPUC decisions, and economic development agency materials were used to compile the above information. Key references include PG&E’s Economic Development Rate fact sheets,, SCE’s program reauthorization details【52:3†source】, SDG&E’s published EDR tariff guidelines【52:2†source】,【52:2†source】, as well as press releases on clean energy incentive efforts by PG&E ,【52:5†source】 and community economic development resources in California【52:4†source】. These illustrate how each utility tailors incentives to **qualifying customers** (e.g. energy-intensive industries or vulnerable communities) with the overarching objectives of **attracting business investment, supporting green energy adoption, and providing rate relief** where it can make a difference. The combination of reduced energy costs and strategic incentives is a cornerstone of California’s approach to keeping its economy competitive and on a path to a cleaner energy future.
