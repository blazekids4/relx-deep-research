# Operational Risks from Third-Party Vendor Failures in Banking (2023–2025)

## Introduction  
Banks increasingly rely on third-party service providers for critical operations, from payment processing and cloud computing to risk management software. This growing dependency has brought innovation and efficiency, but it also introduces significant **operational risks**. In recent years (2023–2025), industry events have underscored how failures or disruptions at external vendors can cascade into banking outages, delayed transactions, data breaches, and even systemic liquidity strains【31:5†source】,【31:5†source】. Regulators and banks alike have taken notice, elevating third-party risk management to a top priority. This report investigates the latest operational risks stemming from third-party vendor failures, analyzes sector-wide trends, and examines how banks are adapting their risk management strategies to manage these external dependencies. It also highlights examples of recent incidents and **regulatory changes** aimed at strengthening third-party risk oversight.

## Rising Third-Party Dependencies and Vulnerabilities  
Modern financial institutions use **thousands of technology-focused service providers** to support their business activities【31:5†source】. Outsourcing to fintechs, cloud operators, and specialized IT vendors can offer cost savings and agility, but it **opens banks to new vulnerabilities**. As one Federal Reserve analysis noted, the *interconnectedness* of third-party providers has become “a key source of vulnerability across the financial system”【31:5†source】. A failure in one critical vendor may **propagate operational disruptions** to many client banks simultaneously. These risks include both cyber-related incidents and technical outages. In fact, regulatory officials warn that the industry’s increasing reliance on a small set of tech vendors (such as major cloud providers or core banking processors) creates a **concentration risk**, where a single point of failure could impact numerous institutions【31:6†source】. Recent studies show the scope of the exposure: **97% of major U.S. banks experienced a third-party data breach in 2024**, indicating nearly universal impact from vendor security failures,. Even more striking, most of those breaches traced back to a tiny fraction of providers, illustrating how **issues with one supplier can have outsized systemic effects**. In summary, the financial sector’s widespread use of third parties has created an **expanded attack surface and operational dependency** that banks must carefully manage to maintain resilience.

## Recent Incidents Highlighting Third-Party Failures (2023–2025)  
Multiple high-profile vendor failures and disruptions between 2023 and 2025 have demonstrated the variety of operational risks banks face from third parties. These incidents have affected everything from trading and payments to online banking access. Key examples include:

- **ION Group Ransomware Attack (Jan 2023)** – A ransomware attack struck ION Trading, a major financial software provider used for clearing and trading derivatives. The **LockBit** malware incident brought down ION’s systems, forcing dozens of European and U.S. banks and brokers to process trades manually【31:6†source】. Derivatives market activity was **hobbled for several days**, prompting regulators like the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to consider tighter cybersecurity requirements for critical vendors【31:6†source】,【31:6†source】. CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam remarked that the industry’s “necessary and increasing reliance on third-party service providers creates a major source of risk,” especially as more banks adopt cloud-based services【31:6†source】.

- **FIS Outage Disrupting Bank Payments (Dec 2024)** – In late 2024, **Fidelity Information Services (FIS)** – a core banking and payments processing vendor – suffered a local power outage and hardware failure that cascaded into a multi-day disruption. At least 27 banks, including Capital One, experienced delays in direct deposits, ACH transfers, and other transactions as FIS’s systems went down,. Customers took to social media reporting missing paychecks and inaccessible funds. Capital One acknowledged “a technical issue with a third-party vendor” was to blame. The outage lasted roughly five days, illustrating how an operational failure at a **single vendor can stall payment flows across many institutions**. Banks had to refund fees and manage customer fallout once systems were restored,.

- **CrowdStrike Software Glitch (July 2024)** – A **faulty software update** from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike triggered a global IT outage that impacted multiple industries, including banking【31:7†source】,【31:7†source】. The glitch affected computers worldwide and disrupted certain bank online services: institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and others reported intermittent login failures or slow transaction processing【31:7†source】. While banks were less severely hit than airlines or media companies in this incident, the **widespread slowdown in financial platforms** was a wake-up call. It underscored that even non-malicious vendor errors can pose systemic risks when a widely used third-party technology falters,【31:7†source】. Industry analysts noted that financial firms’ deepening dependencies on third-party tech mean even a single software supplier’s mistake can ripple through many banks simultaneously【31:7†source】. In the wake of the CrowdStrike outage, experts and rating agencies warned banks to reassess single points of failure and improve their operational resilience planning【31:7†source】.

- **Zelle Payments Outage (May 2025)** – The popular peer-to-peer payments network **Zelle** went down for many customers on May 2, 2025 due to a **third-party vendor issue**. Zelle’s parent company (Early Warning Services) revealed that a technical glitch at one of its key processor partners – later confirmed to be **Fiserv** – caused the service disruption. During the outage, users saw their transactions stuck as “payment pending” and were unable to send or receive money. Major Zelle-participating banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and others were affected. Fiserv attributed the problem to an internal technology issue and resolved it later that day, then worked through a backlog of delayed payments. This incident highlighted how **banks’ customer-facing services can be knocked offline by problems at an external payments provider**, reinforcing the need for vendor oversight even in real-time payment systems.

- **Finastra Breach (Nov 2024)** – Finastra, a leading fintech software vendor whose platforms are used by numerous banks, suffered a significant **data breach** in 2024. Attackers exploited compromised credentials to access Finastra’s secure file transfer system, exposing sensitive bank customer and transaction data【31:3†source】. This breach demonstrated the **cybersecurity dimension of third-party risk**: even if a bank’s own systems are secure, a hack at a vendor with access to the bank’s data can lead to data loss and regulatory penalties【31:3†source】. The incident put many client financial institutions on alert to review their data-sharing arrangements and security requirements for vendors. It underscored that third-party failures aren’t limited to downtime—they can also mean **confidential data leaks and compliance infractions**, requiring robust vendor cyber risk management.

Each of these examples underscores a common theme: when a critical third-party provider fails—whether due to cyberattack, software bugs, or operational breakdowns—the **impacts quickly radiate to dependent banks and their customers**. Payment delays, trading disruptions, customer inability to access accounts, and data compromises all erode trust and create financial strain. As one industry expert observed, a single compromised vendor has the potential to “**destabilize the entire financial system**” given today’s interconnected digital ecosystem,. These events have prompted banks to examine their reliance on key service providers and have accelerated efforts to fortify operational resilience.

## Trends in Third-Party Risk Management Across the Sector  
Across the banking sector, there is a heightened awareness that third-party failures pose **material operational risks**. A few notable trends emerged between 2023 and 2025:

- **Systemic Risk Focus and Concentration Concerns:** Regulators and central banks increasingly view third-party outages as a **systemic stability issue**, not just an individual bank problem. If many institutions rely on the *same* provider (for example, a major core banking processor or cloud platform), that single point of failure can threaten **industry-wide operations**,【31:7†source】. Incidents like the FIS outage and CrowdStrike glitch revealed how one event can simultaneously affect dozens of banks. In response, watchdogs are analyzing concentration risk — e.g. what proportion of banks or critical functions would be impacted if a given vendor went down. The **Financial Stability Board (FSB)** in 2023 issued guidelines urging banks to identify and mitigate risks from critical third-party providers, reflecting global concern on this front【31:7†source】. Similarly, U.S. officials have noted that reliance on a few big tech providers (such as cloud service companies) represents a “major source of risk” as it grows【31:6†source】.

- **Increase in Third-Party Cyber Incidents:** The period saw a surge in cyberattacks targeting vendors that serve financial institutions. Ransomware and supply-chain attacks on tech providers have become a prominent threat. The 2023 ION ransomware case is one example, and numerous banks have also been indirectly affected by breaches at cloud IT management firms, security vendors, and other suppliers. A report in late 2024 found that virtually all large U.S. banks encountered a third-party **data breach** in the prior year. Notably, only a small percentage of vendors were actually compromised, but those few incidents **propagated widely**, indicating that threat actors can cause outsized damage by hitting key nodes in the financial supply chain. This trend has pushed banks to ramp up their cybersecurity due diligence and monitoring of vendors, in addition to their internal defenses.

- **Operational Resilience Testing and Collaboration:** Banks are increasingly conducting **resilience drills and scenario analyses** to prepare for a vendor outage. Industry groups and regulators have organized exercises simulating third-party service provider failures to test how banks would respond【31:1†source】. For example, member banks of the U.S. Payments Risk Committee ran a tabletop simulation of a critical third-party outage to derive lessons on communication, backup processes, and coordination【31:1†source】. The private sector is also sharing more information about critical providers: the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) has a “Critical Providers” program to facilitate intel exchange between banks and key tech firms【31:6†source】. This collaborative approach aims to ensure **closer coordination in case of attacks or outages**, so that industry-wide response can be swift【31:6†source】. Overall, there is a trend toward **treating operational resilience as a collective effort** among financial institutions, rather than each bank fending for itself.

- **Regulatory Scrutiny and Guidance:** (Expanded in the next section) Regulators, noticing these risks, have sharpened their guidance and in some cases their **supervisory powers** to address third-party dependencies. By 2025, banks face more explicit requirements for *third-party risk management (TPRM)* and operational resilience, reflecting a trend of regulatory convergence on this issue. This includes expectations for robust vendor oversight frameworks at each institution, as well as potential direct oversight of critical providers by regulators in some jurisdictions【31:5†source】,【31:5†source】. In short, third-party risk has moved from an ancillary concern to a **front-and-center risk category** in banking, on par with credit or liquidity risk, given its potential to disrupt core services. Banks are adapting accordingly, as detailed below.

## How Banks Are Adapting Risk Management Strategies  
In response to the spate of vendor-related incidents and growing regulatory expectations, banks have been **bolstering their third-party risk management practices**. A proactive and systematic approach is emerging to manage dependencies on external service providers. Key risk management strategies and adaptations include:

- **Stricter Due Diligence and Vendor Selection:** Banks are applying more rigorous vetting before onboarding new vendors. This involves evaluating a vendor’s financial condition, operational resilience, and cybersecurity controls in depth【31:4†source】. For critical services, institutions now often require detailed information on the provider’s technology architecture, data protection measures (encryption, access controls), and incident history【31:4†source】. **Assessments of network and data security are “table stakes”** during due diligence, meaning a vendor must demonstrate strong safeguards before a bank entrusts it with sensitive operations【31:4†source】. Some banks have extended due diligence to fourth parties (the vendor’s own subcontractors) to uncover any hidden risks in the supply chain.

- **Continuous Monitoring of Third-Party Risks:** Instead of a “set-and-forget” approach after onboarding, banks are investing in ongoing monitoring of their vendors’ performance and risk indicators. Many institutions use specialized **vendor risk management software** to track metrics like uptime, security audit results, and compliance status for each third party【31:4†source】. This continuous oversight allows banks to receive early warnings of potential issues – for example, if a vendor’s security rating drops or if it misses SLA (service-level agreement) targets. Leading practices include maintaining a comprehensive **inventory of all third-party relationships** and identifying which vendors support critical functions,. By mapping critical business processes to the vendors that support them, banks can pinpoint single points of failure and create watchlists of high-risk third parties. In 2024, 62% of organizations reported experiencing a supply-chain cyber incident, which has driven adoption of automated tools to continuously scan for vulnerabilities in vendor systems【31:2†source】. 

- **Robust Contracts and Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Banks are re-examining their contracts with vendors to ensure **clear accountability and resilience requirements** are in place. Effective TPRM programs include contractual provisions that detail the vendor’s obligations for security, uptime, data handling, and incident response【31:3†source】,【31:4†source】. Many contracts now explicitly define performance standards (SLAs) and liabilities or indemnification if those standards are not met【31:4†source】. Banks also negotiate clauses that require the vendor to participate in **periodic resilience testing or emergency drills**, share certain risk information (like audit reports or cybersecurity certifications), and notify the bank promptly of any incident. By tightening contracts, banks aim to enforce higher resilience standards and ensure they have legal recourse or exit options if a vendor’s risk profile becomes unacceptable.

- **Improved Business Continuity Planning (BCP):** A major area of adaptation is integrating third parties into banks’ own continuity and disaster recovery plans. Banks are developing detailed **contingency plans for vendor outages**, so they can sustain operations if a provider fails. This might include backup vendors, internal backup systems, or manual workarounds for critical processes. For example, after recent outages, some banks established secondary providers for cloud services or payments processing in case their primary vendor goes down. **Scenario planning and “fire drills”** are conducted more frequently to test these plans. Rather than annual check-the-box drills, banks now hold regular crisis simulations that involve key vendors, ensuring both parties can coordinate if services are disrupted. Incident response plans have been updated to explicitly include third-party incidents – for instance, banks pre-arrange communication protocols with vendors if an outage occurs and develop joint response teams【31:3†source】. The goal is to be able to **respond rapidly and minimize customer impact** when a vendor problem arises, instead of scrambling ad hoc. As one industry panel concluded, “we are jointly responsible” – the vendor and bank must work together in a disruption – so advance planning is critical.

- **Vendor Partnership and Oversight Enhancements:** Forward-looking banks are shifting from a purely transactional relationship with vendors to a more **collaborative partnership model**. Given new regulations (described below) that hold banks accountable for outsourced activities, banks are bringing critical vendors “into the tent” regarding resilience and strategy. This means more frequent governance meetings, sharing of future roadmaps, and involving vendors in the bank’s change management and risk discussions. Many banks have set up dedicated **Vendor Management Offices (VMOs)** or third-party risk committees with senior executives, to govern the lifecycle of vendor relationships【31:4†source】. These governance bodies oversee due diligence, risk assessments, and performance reviews for key suppliers. Banks also invest in training their own staff on third-party risk awareness, so employees understand how to manage and escalate vendor-related issues【31:4†source】. By institutionalizing oversight (with clear roles, responsibilities, and board visibility into third-party risks), banks can more proactively manage their service providers. In essence, the industry is moving toward **embedding third-party risk into the broader enterprise risk framework**, ensuring it gets the same rigor as internal risks【31:4†source】.

- **Diversification and Redundancy:** Although not always feasible, some banks are mitigating dependency risk by avoiding **sole reliance on any one vendor** for critical operations. This can involve multi-vendor strategies such as using multiple cloud providers in parallel (to allow failover) or keeping certain critical functions in-house as a backup even if the primary processing is outsourced. Regulators have hinted that banks should evaluate alternative solutions for critical services in case a third-party fails【31:7†source】,【31:6†source】. For example, following cloud outages and core processor issues, a number of banks began developing secondary processing capabilities or maintaining **hot standby systems** that could take over temporarily if a vendor outage occurs. In practice, switching providers on short notice remains challenging, so banks often focus on ensuring **short-term workarounds** (like manual processing or using Fed facilities as in the earlier case study) to ride through an outage【31:5†source】,【31:5†source】. Nonetheless, the principle of not keeping “all eggs in one basket” is gaining traction in operational risk discussions.

Collectively, these strategy enhancements illustrate that banks are not passive in the face of third-party risks. They are **evolving their risk management to be more preventive, vigilant, and resilient**. Where previously a bank might simply trust a vendor’s promises, now there is active verification, ongoing collaboration, and preparation for the worst-case scenario. As one white paper noted, managing third-party risk is now a “living, breathing” process that must adapt continuously to new threats and ensure the bank can **“keep the lights on”** even if a key partner falters,【31:4†source】.

## Regulatory Changes and Oversight (2023–2025)  
Regulators have responded to third-party risk with a flurry of **guidance and new rules** between 2023 and 2025, aiming to shore up the financial system’s resilience against vendor failures. Banks now face more explicit regulatory expectations for managing third-party relationships, and in some jurisdictions regulators have gained direct oversight powers over critical service providers. Key regulatory developments include:

- **United States – Enhanced Guidance (2023):** U.S. banking regulators (OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC) issued a **final interagency guidance on third-party risk management** in June 2023, replacing earlier fragmented advisories. This unified guidance outlines sound risk management principles across the entire lifecycle of third-party relationships, from planning and due diligence to ongoing monitoring and termination ,. It emphasizes a *risk-based* approach, where banks must identify which vendors and services are **critical** to their operations and apply commensurate oversight. Notably, regulators affirmed their legal authority (under the Bank Service Company Act) to **examine third-party providers** directly when they perform essential functions for banks. The guidance calls for maintaining a comprehensive inventory of vendor contracts, clear risk appetites addressing third-party exposure, and stronger governance over outsourcing,. While not a new law, this 2023 guidance effectively raises the bar, expecting banks to manage vendor risks **as rigorously as internal risks**. U.S. regulators have also focused on cyber resilience: for instance, the federal Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA) will require banks (among others) to report significant cyber incidents to the government. However, observers note that U.S. efforts thus far emphasize incident response and **cybersecurity** preparedness, whereas less attention has been given to preventing non-cyber technical outages like the FIS case. This is an evolving area – agencies continue to issue guidance (e.g. to smaller banks on vendor risk) and there are discussions about whether certain big tech providers should be subject to designation as *systemically important* by the Financial Stability Oversight Council in the future.

- **European Union – Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA, 2023/2025):** The EU has taken a more direct regulatory stance with the adoption of **DORA**, which came into force in 2023 and will apply from January 17, 2025. DORA is a sweeping regulation aimed at ensuring operational resilience in financial services, and it specifically addresses third-party ICT (Information Communications Technology) risk. Under DORA, regulators can **designate certain third-party service providers as “critical”** to the financial system【31:5†source】. Critical providers (which could be major cloud services, core banking software vendors, etc.) will be subject to direct oversight by EU supervisory authorities. DORA mandates that financial firms assess risks of all third-party ICT providers and implement strategies to mitigate concentration risk. It also imposes requirements on vendors and banks for **incident reporting, business continuity, and resilience testing**【31:5†source】. For example, a critical cloud provider in the EU may have to undergo regular **resilience testing and audits**, share cyber incident notifications with regulators and clients, and ensure robust recovery capabilities. By late 2024, banks operating in Europe were actively preparing for DORA compliance – identifying which of their technology vendors are critical, updating contracts to allow necessary information sharing, and bolstering their ICT risk management frameworks. DORA represents a regulatory recognition that **third-party failures can pose systemic risks**, and it attempts to create a supervisory framework to monitor and reduce that risk across the EU financial sector【31:5†source】. This is a significant shift from relying only on banks to manage their vendors, to also **overseeing key vendors at the European level**.

- **United Kingdom – Critical Third Parties Regime (2023):** The UK government introduced legislation in 2023 (as part of the Financial Services and Markets Act reforms) empowering regulators to **designate “critical” third-party providers** to the finance sector【31:5†source】. Under this regime, UK authorities (e.g. the Bank of England, FCA, PRA) can name specific tech providers as critical if their failure could threaten financial stability or consumers. Once designated, those providers come under **direct regulatory supervision**: officials can require information from them, set resilience standards, and intervene (for instance, enforce remediation of vulnerabilities)【31:5†source】,【31:5†source】. This move was driven by concerns that a handful of cloud computing and outsourcing firms underpin a large share of UK banking operations. By giving regulators visibility into these firms, the UK aims to mitigate blind spots where previously only the banks had contractual oversight. The regime is complementary to existing outsourcing guidelines that already require banks to have exit plans and oversight for material third parties. Essentially, the UK in 2023 signaled that **“too big to fail” can apply to tech vendors as well**, and that authorities need tools to prevent a cloud or IT provider outage from spiraling into a systemic crisis.

- **Asia-Pacific and Other Jurisdictions:** Similar regulatory shifts are underway globally. In **Hong Kong**, the HKMA issued an operational resilience framework (OR-2) effective 2023 that, among other things, mandates banks to conduct **scenario testing for severe disruption events**, including failure of a key service provider. Banks in Hong Kong have until 2026 to demonstrate their ability to withstand such shocks. Hong Kong is also introducing a new law to protect critical infrastructure computer systems (covering banks) from cyber disruptions. In **Australia**, the prudential regulator APRA rolled out **CPS 230 Operational Risk Management** (finalized in 2023, effective July 2025) which requires banks to identify critical operations and implement robust controls, **including oversight of critical third-party service providers and even “fifth parties”** (the subcontractors of vendors). CPS 230 will force Australian banks to set impact tolerances (maximum downtime tolerable for services) and ensure contracts and testing with vendors meet new standards. Other countries such as Singapore and India have also updated outsourcing guidelines recently, raising expectations for risk assessment, notification of regulator before using certain overseas service providers, etc. The overall regulatory trend is a **tightening of third-party risk management rules worldwide**, aiming for greater resilience. As one panelist noted, these various regulations all “look for the same thing” – stronger assurance that banks can **remain operational through disruptions**, regardless of whether the cause is internal or from an external vendor.

Regulatory changes are pushing banks not only to strengthen their own vendor oversight, but also effectively forcing closer partnerships with their critical service providers. With regulators raising the bar (e.g. requiring banks to prove they can switch providers or recover quickly), vendors too are under pressure to enhance their services. In fact, industry experts predict that compliance demands will make the vendor-bank relationship more of a **shared responsibility** model. Banks cannot simply rely on an SLA and transfer risk to the vendor; both parties will be “in the same boat” for ensuring continuity. This regulatory momentum – from the U.S. guidance to EU’s DORA – reflects the lessons of recent disruptions: **resilience must be built in at all levels, including third-party arrangements**, to safeguard the financial system【31:5†source】,【31:5†source】.

## Conclusion  
Between 2023 and 2025, a clear message has emerged for banks: **third-party vendor failures are not an isolated inconvenience, but a core operational risk that demands vigilant management**. High-impact incidents – from cyberattacks on tech providers to inadvertent outages – have shown how quickly normal banking services can be knocked offline when a vendor falters. The financial sector’s ongoing digital transformation and outsourcing means this risk will persist, if not grow. In response, banks are fortifying their defenses by overhauling third-party risk management: conducting deeper due diligence, monitoring vendors continuously, hardening contracts, and rehearsing contingency plans. At the same time, regulators have stepped up with new rules and oversight mechanisms to ensure both banks and critical service providers address vulnerabilities. The emerging paradigm is one of **operational resilience by design** – banks must design processes and partnerships such that even if a third-party disruption occurs, the impact is contained and short-lived【31:5†source】,. This involves close collaboration with key vendors, as well as industry-wide coordination for managing systemic risks.

In summary, banks are learning to expect the unexpected from external providers and are adapting by building stronger **shock absorbers**. The trends of 2023–2025 indicate that while third-party services will remain indispensable for innovation and efficiency, they will be paired with equally robust risk controls and regulatory scrutiny. By sharing best practices, investing in resilience, and complying with new frameworks like DORA and others, financial institutions aim to **reap the benefits of outsourcing without compromising stability**. The journey is ongoing – as technology evolves and new third-party dependencies emerge (fintech partnerships, cloud AI services, etc.), banks will need to continuously update their risk strategies. But the progress made in recent years shows a financial sector increasingly alert and responsive to the **operational risks of third-party failures**, striving to keep critical banking services reliable in an interconnected world【31:5†source】,.
