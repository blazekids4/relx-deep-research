# Top 5 Companies for Bundled PC Hardware and Software

Modern PC manufacturers often bundle their computer systems with additional software to enhance value beyond just the operating system. Below are five leading companies known for offering PC hardware (desktops, laptops, or 2-in-1 devices) packaged with integrated software suites that include productivity, security, creative, or other value-added applications. Each entry includes an overview of their hardware lineup and the software bundle highlights, with links to official sources for verification.

## 1. Apple

- **Hardware Offerings:** Apple produces the Mac lineup of personal computers, including MacBook laptops (Air and Pro), iMac all-in-one desktops, Mac mini, and Mac Studio. All Macs run Apple’s own operating system, macOS, ensuring tight integration between hardware and software.  
- **Bundled Software:** Every Mac comes with a suite of Apple-developed applications beyond just macOS. This includes the **iWork** productivity suite – Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets), and Keynote (presentations) – which comes pre-installed to help users create documents, spreadsheets, and slides out-of-the-box【43:1†source】. For creative needs, Macs also include **iMovie** for video editing and **GarageBand** for music creation (part of the former iLife suite), provided free to all Mac users【43:6†source】. Other handy apps like Safari (web browser), Mail, Photos, and FaceTime are built in as well. Apple’s approach is a fully integrated bundle of hardware and first-party software, enabling users to be productive and creative without extra purchases. *(Official Site: apple.com)*

## 2. Microsoft (Surface)

- **Hardware Offerings:** Microsoft’s Surface line encompasses PCs such as the Surface Pro tablets, Surface Laptop, Surface Studio desktop, and Surface Book/ Laptop Studio hybrids. These devices are designed by Microsoft and ship with Windows 11, leveraging Microsoft’s software ecosystem on Microsoft-made hardware.  
- **Bundled Software:** Surface PCs come with **Windows 11** and a collection of Microsoft software beyond the base OS. Notably, they include preloaded **Microsoft 365 (Office) apps** with a free trial of the Microsoft 365 subscription (e.g. a 30-day trial of Office 365 Family)【43:5†source】, so users have immediate access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint and more. Security is handled by built-in **Microsoft Defender** antivirus (part of Windows 11), and Surfaces do not require third-party AV for basic protection【43:5†source】. Many Surface devices also come with the **Xbox app** and a trial of **Xbox Game Pass Ultimate** (typically 30 days) for gaming and entertainment【43:5†source】. Together, the hardware and Microsoft’s software bundle (productivity, security, and entertainment) offer a well-rounded experience on Surface. *(Official Site: microsoft.com)*

## 3. Dell

- **Hardware Offerings:** Dell is a top PC manufacturer with product lines like XPS (premium consumer laptops/desktops), Inspiron (mainstream PCs), Alienware (gaming systems), Latitude (business laptops), and others. All Dell PCs ship with Windows 10 or 11. Dell’s hardware spans from consumer notebooks and desktops to workstations and servers, often noted for quality and enterprise features.  
- **Bundled Software:** Dell computers come preloaded with Windows plus additional software and utilities. Common **Dell-developed tools** include **Dell SupportAssist** and **MyDell** (for system diagnostics and driver updates) as well as **Dell Optimizer**, an AI-based optimization software that adjusts performance, battery life, audio and more for the user’s needs. These help enhance and personalize the PC’s operation. In addition, Dell typically bundles third-party software trials for extra value – for example, many new Dell PCs include a **30-day trial of McAfee** or similar security suite and a **trial of Microsoft Office 365** for productivity【43:3†source】. Dell also frequently offers bundle deals where customers can add discounted software (like Adobe Acrobat, security suites, or creativity apps) when buying a system . This combined hardware and software package ensures buyers have essential tools (security, productivity, support apps) from day one. *(Official Site: dell.com)*

## 4. HP (Hewlett-Packard)

- **Hardware Offerings:** HP produces a wide range of PCs including Pavilion and Envy (consumer laptops/desktops), Spectre (premium ultrabooks), Omen/Victus (gaming), and ProBook/Elite/ZBook (business-class notebooks and workstations). These systems run Windows and often come with tailored features (e.g., high-end audio, security chips) targeting various user segments from home users to enterprises.  
- **Bundled Software:** HP PCs ship with Windows and a collection of HP and partner software. On the consumer side, HP typically includes its **HP Support Assistant** for device health and driver updates, and often preloads a **30-day trial of antivirus** (such as McAfee LiveSafe) and a **one-month trial of Microsoft 365 (Office)** for productivity【43:4†source】. These give users immediate security protection and Office tools (beyond just the OS) upon purchase. For business models, HP distinguishes itself with built-in security software like **HP Wolf Security**. Select enterprise PCs come with **HP Wolf Pro Security Edition** preloaded, which provides advanced endpoint protection (including features like threat containment and hardware-enforced malware isolation). HP Wolf Security comes with a term license (often 1 year or more included) on those machines【43:7†source】, adding value through robust security out-of-the-box. Whether consumer or business, HP’s hardware packages typically bundle software for productivity, security, and system management to enhance the user experience. *(Official Site: hp.com)*

## 5. Lenovo

- **Hardware Offerings:** Lenovo is a leading PC maker known for ThinkPad laptops (business line), IdeaPad and Yoga laptops (consumer and 2-in-1 convertibles), Legion (gaming PCs), and ThinkCentre/ThinkStation desktops. Lenovo systems run Windows and often emphasize durability (ThinkPad’s legacy), innovation (Yoga’s 2-in-1 designs), or performance (Legion gaming).  
- **Bundled Software:** Lenovo bundles its PCs with Windows plus additional software to improve usability and security. A hallmark is **Lenovo Vantage**, a proprietary application pre-installed on Lenovo PCs that helps users personalize settings, update drivers, monitor system health, and optimize performance easily. Many Lenovo consumer laptops also come with Amazon **Alexa** voice assistant app integration out of the box (leveraging far-field mics on some models). Like other OEMs, Lenovo includes trials of important software: typically a **30-day trial of McAfee LiveSafe** (antivirus/security) and a trial of **Microsoft Office 365** for new users【43:2†source】, so customers can secure their device and start working on documents or spreadsheets immediately. These preloads, combined with Lenovo’s own utilities (for system updates, power management, camera privacy, etc.), provide a comprehensive hardware-software bundle. *(Official Site: lenovo.com)*
