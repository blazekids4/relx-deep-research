# Latest Updates on Pugh Capital Management

**Pugh Capital Management** is a Seattle-based institutional fixed-income investment firm founded in 1991. Led by CEO Mary Pugh, the company has grown to manage over $13 billion in assets and is recognized as the largest African American female-owned fixed income firm in the U.S,【234:3†source】. In recent years, Pugh Capital has undertaken significant expansions, leadership transitions, and strategic initiatives, reflecting its growth and evolving business focus.

## Business Expansion via High-Yield Acquisition

One of the most significant recent developments was Pugh Capital’s expansion through a high-yield fixed income acquisition. In April 2025, the firm **acquired the U.S. high-yield business of SKY Harbor Capital Management**, an investment manager based in Greenwich, Connecticut【234:1†source】. This deal added **over $2 billion** in assets, bringing Pugh Capital’s total assets under management to roughly **$13.2 billion**【234:1†source】. The acquisition was strategic in broadening Pugh Capital’s product offerings – it expanded the firm’s focus beyond core and long-duration fixed-income strategies to include **high-yield bond strategies**, allowing Pugh to serve clients across the full credit spectrum.

The integration of the SKY Harbor business also **grew Pugh Capital’s team and capabilities**. SKY Harbor was a women-led firm co-founded by high-yield specialists (Hannah Strasser and Anne Yobage), and its incorporation brought deep high-yield expertise into Pugh’s ranks. Pugh Capital’s investment team expanded to over 20 professionals, strengthening the firm’s credit research and portfolio management resources. According to the firm, the enhanced platform will enable the launch of new products and provide greater scale for long-term growth and client service. Overall, this expansion marks a major initiative for Pugh Capital, significantly increasing its asset base and diversifying its fixed-income solutions.

## Leadership Changes and Team Developments

Pugh Capital has also seen important leadership changes. In early 2023, the firm **appointed Marisa Grant as Chief Investment Officer (CIO)**, effective March 31, 2023. Grant, who joined Pugh Capital in 2020 and had served as co-CIO since 2021, took over the CIO responsibilities from founder Mary Pugh. This transition allowed Mary Pugh to continue focusing on her role as CEO, while Marisa Grant led the firm’s investment strategy and portfolio management team. Grant’s promotion was a notable milestone, as she brought over 25 years of investment experience to the CIO role and reinforced the firm’s commitment to developing diverse leadership.

In the wake of the 2025 high-yield acquisition, Pugh Capital’s senior team further expanded. Notably, **Hannah Strasser**, one of the co-founders of SKY Harbor, joined Pugh Capital as **Head of High Yield and Senior Portfolio Manager** . Strasser brings decades of industry experience (over 40 years) and now oversees Pugh’s high-yield strategies and leads the high-yield investment team . Her addition – along with other team members from SKY Harbor – has bolstered Pugh Capital’s leadership depth in the high-yield segment. The firm remains 100% employee- and founder-owned, and these leadership developments underscore a blend of continuity and new expertise as Pugh Capital grows.

## Strategic Initiatives and Partnerships

Beyond internal growth, Pugh Capital has been involved in external initiatives and partnerships that highlight its industry standing. In January 2024, the **Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)** selected Pugh Capital as one of six firms to participate in PBGC’s **Smaller Asset Managers Program (SAMP)**【234:2†source】,【234:2†source】. This program aims to give smaller and diverse asset managers opportunities to manage portions of PBGC’s pension assets. Pugh Capital had previously been part of the pilot program, and with SAMP becoming a permanent initiative in 2022, Pugh was invited again as a core fixed-income manager【234:2†source】. Under this program, Pugh Capital manages a share of PBGC’s U.S. core fixed-income portfolio (including government, corporate, and mortgage-backed securities), and is held to the same performance and risk standards as larger managers【234:2†source】. The inclusion of Pugh in such a high-profile federal program reflects the firm’s credibility and its status as a leading boutique manager in the fixed-income space.

Pugh Capital’s mission-driven initiatives also continue to emphasize diversity and community impact. The firm is a certified minority- and woman-owned business, and it upholds core values summarized as “POISED” – **Passion, Ownership, Integrity, Service, Excellence, and Diversity** – in both its client work and its community engagements. For example, Mary Pugh and the firm have a longstanding commitment to mentoring and supporting young professionals and students in the Seattle area. While these efforts are ongoing rather than new, they reinforce Pugh Capital’s identity and underpin recent business moves. The 2025 acquisition itself aligned with these values, as it involved partnering with a women-led team and expanding opportunities within the firm.

## Other Developments and Recognition

**Workplace culture and industry recognition** are also part of Pugh Capital’s recent story. The firm has been consistently lauded as an employer of choice. In fact, **Pensions & Investments magazine named Pugh Capital one of the “Best Places to Work in Money Management”** (in the small-firm category) for six consecutive years, from 2018 through 2023【234:3†source】. This recognition highlights the company’s ability to attract and retain diverse talent and foster an inclusive, supportive workplace. Under Mary Pugh’s stewardship, over 80% of the team are women and/or people of color, reflecting the firm’s emphasis on diversity in its workforce.

Additionally, Pugh Capital’s leadership has earned individual accolades. **Mary Pugh (CEO)** was honored in 2023 as one of the inaugural **“Influential Women in Institutional Investing”** by Pensions & Investments, a distinction awarded to 65 women globally for leadership in finance. She also received industry awards from organizations like the National Association of Securities Professionals (NASP) and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, recognizing her contributions to diversity and business excellence. These honors for the firm and its CEO underscore the positive reputation Pugh Capital has built in the investment community.

**In summary,** Pugh Capital Management has recently undertaken major growth initiatives and embraced change while maintaining its mission-driven culture. The 2025 acquisition of a high-yield bond team has significantly expanded its assets and product lineup, the elevation of new leadership talent has positioned it for the future, and participation in programs like PBGC’s SAMP affirms its standing among institutional investors. With approximately $13 billion under management and a strengthened team, Pugh Capital is poised to continue its trajectory as a prominent, values-driven player in fixed-income asset management.
