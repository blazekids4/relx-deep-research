# Operational Risks from Third-Party Vendors and How Banks Are Responding

## Growing Dependence on Third-Party Services and Associated Risks  
Banks today rely on thousands of third-party service providers for critical technology and operations – from payment processing and cloud computing to customer-facing fintech solutions , . This trend boosts efficiency and innovation, but it **also introduces significant operational risks**. When an external provider fails or is disrupted – whether by internal error, outage, or cyberattack – banks can suffer **service outages, data breaches, and even broader financial instability**. For example, a Federal Reserve analysis highlighted that a cyberattack on a payments provider forced the firm offline, **halting client banks’ payment processing and causing cash shortages** until those banks borrowed emergency funds from the Fed . The **interconnectedness of banks and vendors** is now “a key source of vulnerability across the financial system,” as risks at one provider can quickly ripple out to many institutions .

## Key Operational Risks from Third-Party Failures  
Third-party failures or disruptions can impact banks in multiple ways:  

- **Service Outages and Downtime:** If a critical vendor’s systems go down, banks might be unable to deliver essential services. A botched software update by a cybersecurity vendor in 2024 froze millions of computers and **disrupted essential banking services globally**, underscoring how a single vendor glitch can halt operations【114:1†source】. The reliance on a few dominant providers creates fragility – a single point of failure can cascade across many banks.  

- **Cybersecurity Breaches and Data Leaks:** Third-party platforms often have access to sensitive bank data, making them prime targets for hackers. In **November 2024, Finastra – a major fintech provider – suffered a breach** where attackers stole credentials to its file transfer system, exposing confidential bank data. Such **supply chain attacks on software or cloud vendors** remain an important risk; **compromised third-party software can lead to credential theft, data corruption, malware installation, and application outages**【114:6†source】. These incidents can severely undermine a bank’s operations and customer trust.  

- **Compliance and Regulatory Risks:** Banks outsource activities but **retain responsibility for regulatory compliance**【114:2†source】. If a vendor fails to meet legal or security requirements, the bank can face penalties and reputation damage. Regulators emphasize that engaging a third party “does not diminish or remove a bank’s responsibility” to operate safely【114:2†source】. For instance, inadequate oversight of an IT migration by a vendor led to a major UK bank’s system outage in 2018 – resulting in a £48 million fine for the bank due to **poor due diligence and oversight**.  

- **Concentration and Systemic Risk:** Many banks often depend on the *same* few cloud providers, core banking software firms, or payment networks. This concentration means an outage at one tech giant (a cloud data center fire, a payment network glitch, etc.) could simultaneously affect large swaths of the financial sector. **Contagion risk** is a growing concern: regulators note that dependencies on “critical third parties, including technology providers” can create **system-wide vulnerabilities** if those parties fail【114:3†source】.

- **Financial and Liquidity Impacts:** Operational disruptions can quickly turn into financial crises. If a vendor outage prevents transactions, banks may face liquidity strains or lost revenue. In the earlier payment processor example, several banks had to tap central bank facilities to meet cash needs . Similarly, when a key Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) fintech collapsed in 2024, some partner banks could not access customer records, leaving **over 100,000 end-users cut off from their funds for months**【114:8†source】. Such scenarios illustrate how third-party failures can impose direct financial losses and necessitate costly interventions.

## Recent Incidents Underscoring Third-Party Vendor Risks  
Real-world events have highlighted why banks are intensifying focus on third-party risk management. Notable examples include:

- **Finastra Data Breach (2024):** In November 2024, hackers infiltrated Finastra’s secure file transfer platform via compromised credentials, exposing sensitive bank customer data. This breach at a major vendor demonstrated how a security lapse at a third party can become a bank’s problem overnight. It prompted banks to reassess data-sharing arrangements and demand stricter vendor cybersecurity controls.

- **CrowdStrike Software Outage (2024):** A *botched software update* by CrowdStrike (a cybersecurity vendor) in mid-2024 **froze Windows systems worldwide**, crippling computers in banking (as well as healthcare and government)【114:1†source】. Banks dependent on this vendor saw operations grind to a halt. The incident was a stark reminder that even trusted vendors can introduce sudden failure risk, reinforcing the need for robust contingency plans【114:1†source】,【114:1†source】.

- **Payment Processor Cyberattack Case (2023):** Researchers analyzed a case where a tech firm providing payment services to banks was hacked . The provider took its systems offline to stop the attack, but this meant client banks **could not process payments for an extended period**, directly impacting businesses and consumers. The fallout showed how a vendor’s cyber incident can swiftly become a **liquidity and operational emergency** for multiple banks .

- **Synapse Fintech Collapse (2024):** In April 2024, Synapse Financial Technologies – a BaaS middleware provider connecting fintech apps with banks – **filed for bankruptcy**, leaving partner banks unable to reconcile customer accounts【114:8†source】. Over 85,000 users temporarily lost access to ~$160 million in deposits【114:5†source】. The collapse exposed weaknesses in banks’ dependence on fintech third parties and **poor contingency planning** for an intermediary’s failure. Months later, some customers still lacked access to funds, and regulators had to step in with new record-keeping rules to prevent a repeat【114:8†source】,【114:8†source】.

Each of these cases illustrates a different facet of third-party risk – from cybersecurity gaps to technology failures and vendor insolvency – all of which can severely disrupt bank operations. They have accelerated efforts by banks and regulators to strengthen controls around external service providers.

## Strengthening Due Diligence and Ongoing Vendor Oversight  
**Banks are responding by fortifying their third-party risk management (TPRM) programs**, starting with more rigorous upfront due diligence and continuous oversight. Before onboarding vendors, banks now conduct **thorough risk assessments** covering security practices, financial stability, and regulatory compliance of the provider. This vetting is often standardized via detailed questionnaires and frameworks (e.g., based on ISO 27001 or FFIEC guidelines) to ensure no critical risk is overlooked【114:4†source】. 

Importantly, banks **categorize vendors by risk criticality** – for example, labeling certain suppliers as “critical,” “high,” or “low” risk – and scale their oversight accordingly【114:4†source】. Critical vendors (those supporting essential banking functions or holding sensitive data) are subjected to the most stringent reviews. A recent industry survey noted that *not all third-party relationships are equal*, so banks apply “more rigorous risk-management practices” for third parties supporting high-risk or critical activities【114:2†source】,【114:2†source】. 

After onboarding, **continuous monitoring** has become a cornerstone of vendor management. Banks increasingly subscribe to third-party risk monitoring services and dashboards that track a vendor’s cybersecurity posture, incident reports, financial health, and compliance status in real time【114:4†source】. Rather than assume a vendor remains stable, banks demand regular updates – such as **audit reports, security test results, uptime statistics, and notice of any breaches or issues**. This ongoing surveillance allows early detection of weaknesses so that banks can address risks proactively. In the case of the Finastra breach, such vigilance might have flagged credential management issues before they were exploited. 

Banks are also **tightening contractual agreements** with service providers. Contracts now commonly include explicit provisions on security standards, data protection, **service level agreements (SLAs)** for uptime and recovery times, and requirements for the vendor to maintain its own business continuity plans. Clear **incident reporting and response protocols** are stipulated so that if an incident occurs, the vendor must notify the bank immediately and cooperatively resolve the issue. Lessons from past failures have shown that ambiguity in roles or slow communication can exacerbate damage during a crisis.

Ultimately, banks recognize that while they can outsource a service, **they cannot outsource the risk**. As one regulator put it, “with that reliance comes the potential for greater cyber risk. It is ultimately the responsibility of banks to manage their third-party risk”【114:7†source】. This mindset shift has driven banks to invest heavily in beefing up internal vendor risk teams, governance committees, and board-level reporting on third-party risk. Many institutions now have dedicated **Third-Party Risk Management units** that work closely with procurement, IT, and business lines to ensure vendor dependencies are well controlled from start to finish of the relationship.

## Building Operational Resilience for Vendor Disruptions  
Beyond preventative due diligence, banks are placing a new emphasis on **operational resilience** – preparing to **withstand and recover quickly from a third-party failure when it does happen**. Regulators and industry groups have made it clear that disruptions *will* occur, so the focus must be on limiting impact. Key resilience measures include:

- **Identifying Critical Services and Mapping Dependencies:** Banks first determine which of their business services are most critical (e.g. payments, online banking, core ledger) and then map which third-party providers those services depend on【114:1†source】. This *dependency mapping* extends to indirect “fourth parties” as well (vendors of vendors). By knowing the critical links in the chain, a bank can monitor those specific providers more closely and develop contingency plans for them. The CrowdStrike incident revealed how fragile operations become “when dominated by a few providers,” prompting banks to map out single points of failure in their vendor networks【114:1†source】.

- **Business Continuity Planning (BCP) with Vendors:** Banks are revising their BCP to explicitly account for third-party outages. This means **differentiating critical vendors** and ensuring each has robust continuity plans that align with the bank’s own recovery objectives【114:1†source】. Banks now regularly obtain and review vendors’ BCP and disaster recovery test results. For the most critical providers, banks may insist on joint crisis exercises or require the vendor to maintain alternate backup sites. Internally, banks set up playbooks: for example, *“What if our cloud provider’s data center goes down?”* – with predefined actions such as switching to a secondary site or throttling certain services. The OCC (a U.S. regulator) has noted that simply having redundant capital or liquidity won’t help in a tech outage; instead, **advance planning and testing** are vital for true resilience【114:7†source】,【114:7†source】.

- **Redundancy and Backup Providers:** Where feasible, banks are reducing single-vendor concentration by sourcing backup providers or building secondary solutions. For instance, a bank might engage two cloud service providers in different regions, or keep a basic in-house processing capability as a fallback. **“What if our primary partner fails? What backup plans are in place?”** is now a standard question during risk reviews【114:4†source】. In some cases, industry utilities or consortiums are explored as safety nets so that if one vendor fails, an alternative channel exists to continue service【114:4†source】. This approach proved valuable after the Synapse collapse, where the lack of an immediate substitute hindered fintech customers’ access to funds for weeks.

- **Scenario Testing and Drills:** Banks are moving beyond paperwork plans to **simulate vendor failure scenarios**. Many conduct **tabletop exercises and stress tests** where an important third-party service suddenly becomes unavailable【114:4†source】. These drills involve not only internal teams but sometimes the vendor and even regulators. They test things like how quickly systems can failover to backups, how communications would flow to customers, and how long the bank can operate in “degraded mode” without the vendor. Regulators in the UK and EU now require large banks to set *impact tolerances* – e.g. maximum acceptable downtime for critical services – and demonstrate via testing that they could meet those tolerances even in a severe third-party outage scenario【114:9†source】,【114:9†source】. Regular testing has helped banks uncover gaps (for example, missing access to vendor data needed during an outage) and improve their response plans.

- **Collaborating with Vendors on Resilience:** Banks are also pushing their vendors to up their game. They prefer providers who **voluntarily adhere to strong risk management and transparency**, as such partners “allow banks to streamline oversight…and often face less regulatory scrutiny”【114:4†source】. Some banks are in frequent dialogue with critical suppliers about emerging risks and jointly developing mitigation steps. In essence, banks seek to treat key vendors almost as an extension of the enterprise when it comes to resilience – sharing *incident response plans*, coordinating recovery strategies, and even contractually requiring participation in the bank’s resilience tests. This two-way street was highlighted by Federal Reserve researchers, who noted that **“ongoing maintenance and planning by both third-party providers *and* the financial firms that use them are critical for improving resilience and preventing spillover effects”** .

With these initiatives, banks aim to ensure that even if a third-party service is disrupted, they can continue operating their **“important business services” with minimal impact**. The goal of operational resilience is not zero failures, but rather to **limit the customer harm and financial instability that a vendor failure could cause**, by being prepared to quickly isolate and absorb the shock.

## Heightened Regulatory Scrutiny and Compliance Measures  
Recognizing the systemic risks posed by third-party dependencies, regulators worldwide have stepped in with stricter rules and guidance. Banks are adapting by enhancing compliance and governance around outsourcing:

- **Stronger Regulatory Guidance:** In the U.S., banking regulators (Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC) issued new **interagency guidance on third-party risk management in 2023**, consolidating expectations for due diligence, risk monitoring, and contingency planning across the entire vendor lifecycle【114:2†source】,【114:2†source】. The guidance makes clear that banks should **identify critical vendors, ensure robust oversight, and have exit strategies** if a third-party can no longer perform【114:2†source】,【114:2†source】. Banks have been updating their policies to align with this, often by formalizing board oversight of outsourcing and documenting detailed risk assessments for every significant vendor.

- **Operational Resilience Regulations:** Regulators are moving beyond traditional outsourcing guidelines to **mandate operational resilience outcomes**. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the U.S. is exploring **“baseline operational resilience requirements”** for large banks, explicitly including expectations for third-party service providers【114:7†source】. These likely involve defining **tolerances for disruption**, requiring regular **resilience testing**, and setting standards for **critical third-party governance**【114:7†source】. Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu compared banks’ tech reliance to global supply chains with hidden vulnerabilities, arguing that only clear resilience standards and testing will ensure banks can withstand disruptions【114:7†source】,【114:7†source】.

- **Direct Oversight of Critical Vendors:** In some jurisdictions, regulators are extending their reach to the tech firms themselves. The UK passed a law in 2023 empowering authorities to designate certain third-party providers as “critical” and **subject them to oversight and stress testing** much like banks . Similarly, the European Union’s **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)**, which fully applies from January 2025, establishes a framework to **identify critical ICT service providers and impose requirements** on them ,. Under DORA, key tech vendors to financial entities will have to meet stringent standards for incident reporting, cyber defense, data backup, and recovery capabilities, and they can be audited by European supervisory authorities . Banks operating in the EU are busy preparing to comply with DORA’s rules, which effectively require them to **ensure their vendors are also resilient and regulated**. This is a significant shift, as it acknowledges that safeguarding the financial system may sometimes require **direct regulation of the third parties** on which banks depend.

- **Enhanced Reporting and Recordkeeping:** In response to events like the Synapse collapse, regulators are shoring up specific risk areas. For example, the U.S. FDIC in late 2024 proposed a rule to strengthen **recordkeeping for deposits handled via third parties**, to ensure banks can quickly identify and return customer funds if a fintech partner fails【114:8†source】. Regulators are also requiring more detailed incident reports from banks regarding any major outage or breach at a third-party, often within tight timeframes. These trends force banks to maintain better visibility into their vendors’ operations and to plan for worst-case scenarios. A senior advisor noted that after recent fintech failures, **“expectations are rising, particularly with respect to contingency planning and financial controls”** in bank–fintech partnerships【114:8†source】.

- **Accountability and Governance:** Globally, there’s a push to hold senior management and boards accountable for third-party risk. Regulations like the UK’s operational resilience framework (PS21/3) and MAS guidelines in Singapore require that banks’ governance structures clearly assign responsibility for outsourcing risks and that resilience is treated as a strategic issue, not just an IT problem【114:9†source】,【114:9†source】. Many banks have accordingly elevated third-party risk discussions to the board level and include vendor failure scenarios in enterprise-wide stress testing and recovery planning exercises.

In summary, **banks are facing a “barrage of resilience requirements” from regulators【114:7†source】**, all aimed at ensuring the financial system can cope with third-party disruptions. Complying with these means banks must demonstrate robust risk management of vendors – from more comprehensive due diligence files, to audited business continuity plans, to clear contractual rights over data and assistance during incidents. While meeting these standards can be challenging, especially as rules evolve, banks are leveraging industry frameworks and collaborations (e.g. shared assessments, industry utilities for vendor info) to keep pace. The end result is a significantly heightened focus on third-party dependencies as a core part of banks’ operational risk profiles.

## Conclusion  
Failures or disruptions at third-party service providers have emerged as a **major operational risk for banks**, capable of causing everything from minor service hiccups to industry-wide instability. High-profile breaches, outages, and fintech collapses in recent years have driven home the point that a bank’s resilience is only as strong as the weakest link in its vendor network. In response, banks in the financial sector are **bolstering their risk management strategies**: performing deeper due diligence, continuously monitoring vendor health, and planning for the day when an external provider might go offline or implode. They are investing in redundancy, crafting detailed contingency plans, and regularly drilling for worst-case scenarios to ensure critical services stay running. At the same time, regulators have raised the bar with new rules and oversight approaches, pushing banks to tighten controls and even prodding third-party tech firms to enhance their resilience. 

All these efforts – from stronger contracts to new regulatory frameworks – reflect an industry adapting to its growing reliance on outside providers. By strengthening third-party risk management and operational resilience, banks aim to **mitigate dependency risks and safeguard their customers and the broader financial system** from the next vendor failure. While it’s impossible to eliminate all third-party risk, the financial sector is moving toward a future where banks can **weather the shock of a provider disruption** without threatening their own stability or that of the markets they serve. Robust preparation, oversight, and collaboration are turning third-party partnerships from a potential Achilles’ heel into a more manageable aspect of modern banking operations.
